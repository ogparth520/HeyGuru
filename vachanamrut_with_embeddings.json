    "content": "Constantly Engaging The Mind On The Svarup Of Bhagvãn \n \n1.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1876, on the night of Mãgshar sud 4 [20th \nNovember, 1819], Shreeji Mahãrãj had come to the residential hall of \nthe sãdhus, in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n1.2 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then asked, “What is the most difficult of all spiritual \nactivities?”  \n \n1.3 \nThe brahm-chãris, sãdhus, and grahasthas, answered according to \ntheir understanding, but no one could give a satisfactory reply. \n \n1.4 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Allow me to answer.  There is no spiritual \nactivity more difficult than to continuously engage the mind on the \nsvarup of Bhagvãn.  The shãstras state that there is no greater \nachievement for a person whose mind’s vrutti is constantly focused \non the murti of Bhagvãn.  This is because the murti of Bhagvãn is like \na chintãmani.  Just as a person who possesses a chintãmani attains \nwhatever he desires, a person whose mind’s vrutti is constantly \nfocused on the murti of Bhagvãn can instantly see, if he so wishes, the \nsvarups of jeev, ishvar, Mãyã, and Brahm.  He can also see Vaikunth, \nGolok, Brahm-Mahol, and other dhãms of Bhagvãn.  Therefore, there \nis no spiritual activity more difficult, nor is there any greater \nachievement, than to continuously engage the mind’s vrutti on the \nmurti of Bhagvãn.” \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 22 - \n1.5 \nThen, Sheth Govardhan-Bhãi asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “What is the \nnature of Bhagvãn’s mãyã?” \n \n1.6 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Mãyã is anything that obstructs a bhakta of \nBhagvãn, while he is performing dhyãn of Bhagvãn’s murti.” \n \n1.7 \nThen, Muktãnand Swãmi enquired, “When a bhakta leaves his \nphysical body, which is composed of the five bhuts, and goes to \nAkshardhãm, what type of body does he attain?” \n \n1.8 \nShreeji Mahãrãj answered, “A bhakta who has sought refuge in the \nDharma-Kul will attain a brahmay body by the wish of Bhagvãn.  \nWhen such bhaktas leave their body and go to Akshardhãm, some go \nby sitting on Garud, some go by sitting on a rath, and others go by \nsitting on a vimãn.  This is how they reach the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  \nThose who have mastered yog-samãdhi, can actually witness these \nevents.” \n \n1.9 \nThen, Harji Thakkar asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “Some have been \npractising satsang for quite some time, yet they do not have the \nintense love for satsang as they do for their own body and their \nrelatives.  What is the reason for this?” \n \n1.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “Such a person has not fully realised the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn.  When a sant, by whose association the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn can be fully realised, talks to him about his \nsvabhãv, the person is not able to change his behaviour.  Instead, he \ndevelops hatred towards the sant that has advised him.  It is due to \nthis sinful act that he does not develop intense love for satsang.  After \nall, sins committed elsewhere, are washed away by association with a \nsant.  But sins committed against a sant, are washed away only by the \ngrace of the sant himself, not by any other means.  The shãstras also \nstate: \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 23 - \nanya-kshetre krutam pãpam tirth-kshetre vina-shyati \ntirth-kshetre krutam pãpam vajra-lepo bhavi-shyati \nSins committed elsewhere are destroyed at a place of pilgrimage, \nbut sins committed at a place of pilgrimage are as though etched in iron. \n \n1.11 “Therefore, if a person does not have hatred towards the sant, he \ndevelops intense love for satsang.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 1 || 1 ||",

    "content": "Uttam, Madhyam, And Kanishth Levels Of Vairãgya \n \n2.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1876, on the night of Mãgshar sud 5 [21st \nNovember, 1819], Shreeji Mahãrãj had come to the residential hall of \nthe sãdhus, in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n2.2 \nThen, Mayãrãm Bhatt asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “Mahãrãj, please \ndescribe the characteristics of the three levels of vairãgya – uttam, \nmadhyam, and kanishth.” \n \n2.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “A person who has the uttam \nvairãgya, engages in worldly activities, either by the ãgnã of Bhagvãn, \nor as a result of his responsibilities; but like Janak Rãjã, he is not \naffected by those worldly activities.  He may indulge in the most \ntempting of the five vishays (shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh) \nattained as a consequence of his responsibilities, but he does so \nunwillingly.  Those vishays are unable to attract him, so his tyãg \nremains undiminished.  He invariably views those vishays as flawed, \nand treats them like enemies.  Moreover, he constantly remains in \ncontact with sãdhus, and shãstras, and remains in the sevã of \nBhagvãn.  Even if he were to come across difficult desh, kãl, and sang, \nGADHADÃ I \n- 24 - \nhis understanding would not weaken.  Such a person is said to \npossess uttam vairãgya. \n \n2.4 \n“A person who has madhyam vairãgya, also indulges in the most \nappealing of the five vishays and remains unattached to them.  \nHowever, if he were to encounter difficult desh, kãl, and sang, he \nwould become attached to those vishays, causing his vairãgya to \ndecline.  Such a person is said to possess madhyam vairãgya. \n \n2.5 \n“As for a person who has kanishth vairãgya, if he were to encounter \nordinary or inferior vishays, he may indulge in them, but would not \nbecome bound by them.  However, if he were to encounter and \nindulge in appealing vishays, he would become bound by them.  Such \na person is said to possess kanishth vairãgya.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 2 || 2 ||",

    "content": "Remembering The Leelãs Of Bhagvãn \n \n3.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1876, on the night of Mãgshar sud 6 [22nd \nNovember, 1819], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A \nsabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \n \n3.2 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Even a person who can constantly see the \nmurti of Bhagvãn in his heart, should recall the leelãs performed by \nBhagvãn in His different avatãrs in different places.  He should also \nmaintain love for brahm-chãris, sãdhus and satsangis, and should \nalways remember them.  If at the time of death he forgets the murti of \nBhagvãn, but remembers the leelãs performed by Him in the different \nplaces, or if he remembers satsangis, brahm-chãris or sãdhus, then he \nwill also remember the murti of Bhagvãn.  In this way, that person \nattains a high spiritual status and benefits greatly.  That is why I \nGADHADÃ I \n- 25 - \nperform grand Vishnu-yãgs, annually celebrate Janamãshtmi, \nEkãdashi, and other festivals, and gather brahm-chãris, sãdhus and \nsatsangis on these occasions.

    "content": "Jealousy Like That Of Nãradji \n \n4.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1876, on Mãgshar sud 7 [23rd November, 1819], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n4.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Haribhaktas should not have jealousy \namongst each other.”   \n \n4.3 \nÃnandãnand Swãmi replied, “Mahãrãj, even then jealousy still \nremains.”  \n \n4.4 \nHearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj explained “If a person does hold \njealousy within them, it should be like that of Nãradji.  Once, both \nNãradji and Tumbru went to Vaikunth for the darshan of Lakshmi-\nNãrãyan.  There, Tumbru sang before them.  Both Lakshmiji and \nNãrãyan were so pleased that they rewarded him with their clothes \nand jewellery.  Seeing this Nãradji became jealous of Tumbru, and \nthought, ‘I shall also learn to sing like Tumbru, so I can please \nBhagvãn’. \n \n4.5 \n“Nãradji learned the art of singing, and sang before Bhagvãn.  But \nBhagvãn replied, ‘You do not know how to sing like Tumbru’.  Then, \nNãradji performed tap to please Shiv, and received his blessings to \nmaster the art of singing.  However, when he sang again, Bhagvãn \nGADHADÃ I \n- 26 - \nstill was not pleased with his singing.  So he practised his singing for \nseven manvantars.  Despite this, Bhagvãn still was not pleased. \n \n4.6 \n“Finally, Nãradji learned to sing from Tumbru himself, and then sang \nbefore Shree Krishna Bhagvãn in Dvãrikã.  Only then was Shree \nKrishna pleased, and rewarded Nãradji with His clothes and \njewellery.  Nãradji then abandoned his jealousy towards Tumbru. \n \n4.7 \n“Therefore, if a person is to hold jealousy within themselves, then he \nshould perceive the gun of the person that he is jealous of.  He should \nalso abandon his own avgun.  If this cannot be done, then a bhakta \nshould at least totally abandon any form of jealousy that would result \nin harming another bhakta.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 4 || 4 ||",

He \nwas dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well \nas haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n5.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A person should perform dhyãn upon \nShree Krishna Bhagvãn together with Rãdhikãji.  If he cannot hold the \nmurti within the heart whilst performing dhyãn, he should not lose \nfaith and stop the dhyãn like a coward.  Those who are persistent in \nthis way will earn the immense grace and darshan of Bhagvãn.  \nMoreover, Bhagvãn will be bound by their bhakti.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 5 || 5 || \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 27 -",

    "content": "A Person With Wisdom And A Person Without Wisdom \n \n6.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1876, on Mãgshar sud 9, [25th November, 1819], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n6.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “In satsang, a person who is wise, \nincreasingly finds avgun within himself, and perceives gun in \nBhagvãn and His bhakta.  Moreover, when Bhagvãn and His sant utter \nharsh words of advice for his own benefit, he accepts them as \nbeneficial, and is not hurt by them.  Such a person steadily attains \ngreatness in satsang. \n \n6.3 \n“Conversely, a person who lacks wisdom, practices satsang and \nlistens to talk about satsang, but continually perceives gun within \nhimself.  When Bhagvãn and His sant highlight his avgun and advise \nhim, he misinterprets such advice due to his arrogance.  He perceives \navgun in the person advising him.  Such a person steadily declines, \nand loses his reputation in satsang.  Therefore, if a person abandons \nthe pride of his own gun, and remains brave, and keeps faith in \nBhagvãn and His sant, his ignorance is eradicated, and he attains \ngreatness in satsang.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 6 || 6 ||",

He \nGADHADÃ I \n- 28 - \nwas dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n7.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “No one is able to understand the \nphilosophical principles found in the shãstras.  In fact, all are \nconfused by them.  Therefore, please listen as I explain those \nprinciples precisely as they are. \n \n7.3 \n“When the jeev behaves as if united with the three bodies of sthul, \nsukshma, and kãran, it is known as the anvay form of the jeev.  When \nthe jeev is distinct from these three bodies and described as eternal, \nit is known as the vyatirek form of the jeev. \n \n7.4 \n“Ishvar, when together with its three bodies of virãt, sutrãtmã, and \navyãkrut, is its anvay form.  When ishvar is distinct from these three \nbodies and is described as eternal, it is known as the vyatirek form of \nishvar. \n \n7.5 \n“When Akshar-Brahm pervades Mãyã and the countless millions of \nbrahmãnds that evolve from Mãyã, it is said to be in its anvay form.  \nWhen Mãyã is distinct from everything and has the attributes of \nsachidãnand, it is known as the vyatirek form of the Mãyã. \n \n7.6 \n“When Shree Krishna Bhagvãn is the antaryãmi and the controller of \nAkshar-Brahm, the ishvars, the jeevs, Mãyã and the brahmãnds that \nevolve from Mãyã, it is said to be the anvay form of Bhagvãn.  When \nHe is distinct from all and resides amidst the light of Brahm in Golok, \nit is said to be the vyatirek form of Bhagvãn. \n \n7.7  “These five entities – Purushottam Bhagvãn, Akshar-Brahm, Mãyã, \nishvar, and jeev – are eternal.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 7 || 7 || \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 29 -",

    "content": "Engaging The Indriyas In The Sevã Of Bhagvãn And His Sant \n \n8.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1876, on Mãgshar sud 11 [27th November, 1819], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.  \n \n8.2 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then said, “If the indriyas are engaged in the sevã of \nShree Krishna Bhagvãn and His bhakta, then the antah-karans are \npurified and the sins, which have been attached to the jeev for \neternity, are destroyed.  On the other hand, if the vruttis of the \nindriyas are directed towards women and other vishays, then a \nperson’s antah-karans become polluted and he falls from the path of \nkalyãn. \n \n8.3 \n“Therefore, a person should indulge in the vishays only as prescribed \nin the shãstras, but should never indulge in them by disobeying the \nniyams that are described in the shãstras.  Also, a person should keep \nthe company of a sant and should avoid kusang.  In this way, when a \nperson avoids kusang and keeps the company of a sant, the sense of \n‘I-ness’ that he has towards his body and the sense of ‘my-ness’ that \nhe has towards his bodily relations, are destroyed.  He also develops \nprofound love for Bhagvãn, and vairãgya towards everything except \nBhagvãn.”  \n \n8.4 \nThen, on that same day, three hours after sunrise, Swãmi Shree \nSahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr, facing \nthe neem tree.  A sabhã of paramhans was seated underneath the \nneem tree.  Grahastha satsangis were also seated in the sabhã.  \nSãnkhya-yogi and female bhaktas were also seated in the sabhã. \n \n8.5 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Paramhans.  Talk about your strengths in \nsatsang; and if there is a weakness, then do no talk about it.  Only talk \nGADHADÃ I \n- 30 - \nabout the strengths.  Whoever has firm nishchay in Bhagvãn, should \ntalk about that; and whoever has great knowledge about the ãtmã, \nshould talk about that – ‘I am not a body; I am an ãtmã’.  Also, those \nwho have the strength of one of the five qualities – nirlobhi, or \nnishkãmi, or nispruhi, or nisvãdi, or nirmãni – talk about your \nstrength.” \n \n8.6 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj happily said, “First, I will talk about my \nstrength.  Then, you will talk about your strength.” \n \n8.7 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “By the grace of Nar-Nãrãyan, I know I \nam an ãtmã, I am achhedhya, I am abhedhya, and I am sachidãnand.  \nMy greatness is due to the strength of my own svarup, and upãsanã of \nNar-Nãrãyan; it is not due to expensive clothes, valuable jewellery, \nchariots, pãlkhi, elephants, and horses.  Also, my greatness is not due \nto all the satsangi men and kings in the world standing before me \nwith folded hands.  If they were to leave satsang and become \nvimukhs, and if I do not have clothes to wear or a place to live, I will \nnot feel inferior.  My upãsanã of Nar-Nãrãyan is the cause of my \ngreatness, and it is the reason that I know ‘I am brahm’, and how I \nknow ‘I am an ãtmã’.  If I try to leave my greatness, or if other devs try \nto reduce my greatness, it still will not diminish. \n \n8.8 \n“My upãsanã of the Nar-Nãrãyan, who is Parbrahm and Paramãtmã, \nis such that ‘This Bhagvãn has a sãkãr murti’.  If someone speaks of \ntheir experiences, or uses shãstras to convince me that Bhagvãn is \nnirãkãr, I will never trust their talks.  This is because, due to His \ngrace, I can see the sãkãr svarup of Bhagvãn in front of me. \n8.9 \n“In my heart, I understand that those who say Bhagvãn is nirãkãr, \nhave not fully understood Him, have never had darshan of His svarup, \nand they do not understand the shãstras.  In the shãstras, those who \nhave written that Bhagvãn has a nirãkãr svarup, have written this to \nshow that Bhagvãn’s svarup is not like our mãyik svarup.  In \nBhagvãn’s physical body, the features that can be destroyed – five \nGADHADÃ I \n- 31 - \nbhuts, ten indriyas, four antah-karans – are not like those found in \nhumans.  It is for this reason that the shãstras have described \nBhagvãn as nirãkãr. \n \n8.10 “The indriyas that are in Bhagvãn’s body cannot be destroyed.  With \nhis eyes, he looks towards Purush, who then looks towards Mãyã.  \nThis causes millions of universes to evolve from Mãyã.  In these \nuniverses, the devs evolve, and in each universe, the sthãvar and \njangam objects form.  This proves that Bhagvãn has eyes. \n \n8.11 “Then, when the universe and all the sthãvar and jangam objects are \ndestroyed, and mahã-pralay occurs, only Bhagvãn remains.  The Veds \nthen pray to Bhagvãn.  Listening to these prayers, he creates the \nuniverse again.  This proves that Bhagvãn has ears. \n \n8.12 “In this way, there are fourteen indriyas, which are alokik and cannot \nbe explained. \n \n8.13 “Through physical svarups, such as Rãm and Krishna, Bhagvãn comes \nto earth for the kalyãn of the jeevs.  Due to his extreme compassion, \nhe takes a svarup that can be seen by the jeev.  Bhagvãn believes that \nif he does not take a physical svarup that can be seen, then how will \nthe jeev perform dhyãn, smaran, and pujã?  For this reason, Bhagvãn \ntakes a pratyaksha svarup that can be seen by all – both satsangis and \nkusangis. \n \n8.14 “But, Bhagvãn is the way He is.  His indriyas or body do not become \nmãyik just because the jeev is able to see Him.  For this reason, I can \nnever believe anyone who claims that Bhagvãn is nirãkãr. \n8.15 “If all the females in the universe come to my sevã, and if all the \nobjects in the universe are offered to me, I will not become attached \nto them.  This is due to the strength from my upãsanã of Nar-\nNãrãyan.  But, even if I do become attracted to these objects, I am not \nattached to them.  This is due to the grace of my Bhagvãn, who allows \nme to have firm knowledge of my own svarup. \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 32 - \n8.16 “I do not know how to give someone a son, give money, make the \ndead come alive, or kill someone.  But, I do know how to give kalyãn \nto a jeev, and take that jeev to Akshardhãm.  I shall not speak \nanymore.  If I do speak, I will end up speaking more than I should.” \n \n8.17 Saying all this, Mahãrãj looked at all the paramhans, with cool eyes \nlike the season of Sharad.  He then said, “Now, talk about your own \nstrengths in satsang.” \n \n8.18 Mahãrãj then said, “You and I have the same strengths.  Therefore, \nmy strengths are a part of you.  Keep firm nishchay in everything I \nhave said today.”  In this way, Mahãrãj explained his own strengths in \nsatsang for the benefit of the bhaktas.  In reality, He Himself is \nPurushottam Nãrãyan. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 8 || 8 ||",

He \nwas dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n9.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Suppose a person has developed \nnishchay in pratyaksha Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, offers bhakti to Him, \nand has His darshan.  But, despite this, he still does not consider \nhimself fulfilled, and instead, feels a deficiency within his antah-\nkarans.  He thinks, ‘As long as I have not seen the radiant svarup of this \nvery same Bhagvãn in Golok, Vaikunth, and other dhãms, I have not \nattained ultimate kalyãn’.  Talks about Bhagvãn should not be heard \nfrom a person with such ignorance. \n \n9.3 \n“If a person has firm nishchay in pratyaksha Bhagvãn, believes \nhimself to be fulfilled merely by His darshan and desires nothing else, \nGADHADÃ I \n- 33 - \nthen Bhagvãn Himself forcefully shows him His divine powers and \nmurtis in His dhãms. \n \n9.4 \n“Therefore, a person with firm nishchay in Bhagvãn, should desire \nnothing, except pratyaksha Bhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 9 || 9 ||",

    "content": "The Ungrateful Sevak-Rãm \n \n10.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Mãgshar sud 13 [29th November, 1819], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well \nas haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n10.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Once, when I was travelling from \nVenkatãdri to Setubandh Rãmeshvar, I came across a sãdhu by the \nname of Sevak-Rãm.  He had studied Shreemad Bhãgvat and other \nPurãns.  During his journey, he fell ill.  With him, he had a thousand \nrupees worth of gold coins.  However, as he had no one to nurse him, \nhe began to cry.  I consoled him, and said, ‘Do not worry about \nanything.  I shall look after you’. \n \n10.3 “On the outskirts of the village, there was a banana orchard, where \nthere was a banyan tree that was home to a thousand ghosts.  The \nsãdhu had become extremely ill and was unable to walk any further.  \nI felt extreme pity for him.  So I prepared a bed of banana leaves one-\nand-a-half feet high under the banyan tree.  As the sãdhu was \nsuffering from dysentery and was passing blood, I would wash him \nand attend to him. \n \n10.4 “He would give me enough of his money to buy sugar, ghee, and \ngrains for himself.  I would bring the ingredients, cook them, and \nGADHADÃ I \n- 34 - \nthen feed him.  As for myself, I would go to the village for my meals.  \nOn some days, when I did not receive any food from the village, I had \nto do upvãs.  Despite this, that sãdhu never once said to me, ‘I have \nenough money.  Cook for both of us so that you may dine with me’. \n \n10.5 “After serving the sãdhu for two months in this way he began to \nrecover.  Then, as we walked towards Setubandh Rãmeshvar, he \nmade me carry his belongings weighing about twenty kilograms, \nwhereas he walked with only a mãlã in his hand.  By then, he was \nhealthy and capable of digesting half a kilogram of ghee, yet he still \nmade me carry his load while he walked empty-handed.  In actual \nfact, my nature was such that I would not keep even a handkerchief \nwith me.  But respecting him as a sãdhu, I walked carrying his \nbelongings weighing twenty kilograms. \n \n10.6 “Although I served that sãdhu and helped him recover, he did not \noffer me even a single penny worth of food.  Therefore, realising him \nto be ungrateful, I abandoned his company.  In this way, a person \nwho does not appreciate favours done by others should be known as \na krutaghni.  \n \n10.7 “In addition, if a person has committed a sin but has performed the \nprãyshchit for it as written in the shãstras, then whoever still \nconsiders him a sinner should himself be considered a sinner, just \nlike a krutaghni.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 10 || 10 ||",

He \nwas dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 35 - \n11.2 Then, Brahmãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, what is the nature of \nvãsnã?” \n \n11.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “A desire within the antah-karans to enjoy \nvishays that have been previously seen, heard, or encountered, is \ncalled vãsnã.  Moreover, a desire within the antah-karans to enjoy \nvishays that have not previously been encountered, is also called \nvãsnã.” \n \n11.4 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, who can we call an ekãntik \nbhakta of Bhagvãn?” \n \n11.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person who has no vãsnã other than \nBhagvãn, and who thinks himself to be brahm-rup as he offers bhakti \nto Bhagvãn, is known as an ekãntik bhakta.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 11 || 11 ||",

    "content": "Creation And Destruction \n \n12.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Mãgshar sud Punam [1st December, \n1819], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of \nsãdhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n12.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “When a person understands the nature of \nthe causes of the entire creation, specifically Purush, Prakruti, Kãl, \nand the twenty-four tattvas, including maha-tattva, then he is \nreleased from the bondage of his avidyã, and the twenty-four tattvas \nthat evolve from avidyã.” \n \n12.3 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, how can their nature be \nknown?” \nGADHADÃ I \n- 36 - \n12.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Their nature can be realised by knowing \ntheir characteristics.  I shall now describe those characteristics. \n \n12.5 “Purush is the controller of Prakruti, and is also distinct from her.  He \nis indivisible, without a beginning, and without an end.  He is self-\nluminous, omniscient, imperishable, satya, kshetragna, and the cause \nof all the activities that possess a form.  Also, he has a divya body. \n \n12.6 “Prakruti is composed of the three gun.  She is both jad and chaitanya, \neternal, nirvishesh, the kshetra of all the jeevs and all the elements, \nincluding maha-tattva.  She is also the divine power of Bhagvãn. \n \n12.7 “Mãyã is nirvishesh, and the three gun of Mãyã are normally in the \nstate of equilibrium.  That which disturbs Mãyã, is called Kãl. \n \n12.8 “Now I shall describe the characteristics of maha-tattva and the other \nelements, so please listen. \n \n12.9 “Chitt and maha-tattva should not be regarded as being different.  \nThe entire world resides in a small form within maha-tattva, which \nitself is unchanging, luminous, pure, peaceful, and full of pure sattva-\ngun. \n \n12.10 “Ahankãr is composed of the three gun, and is the cause of the \nevolution of all bhuts, indriyas, antah-karans, their presiding devs, and \nthe prãns.  It is peaceful, dense, and totally ignorant.  \n \n12.11 “The man is the place where all the desires for women and other \nobjects are generated.  It is subject to random thoughts, and is the \ncontroller of all the indriyas. \n \n12.12 “Buddhi possesses the knowledge of all the objects.  The specific \nknowledge which all the indriyas possess, is due to the buddhi.  Its \nnatural features are sanshay, nishchay, nindrã, and smruti. \n  \nGADHADÃ I \n- 37 - \n12.13 “The characteristics of the ten indriyas – the ears (shrotra), the skin \n(tvak), the eyes (chakshu), the tongue (rasnã), the nose (ghran), the \nvoice (vãk), the hands (pãni), the feet (pãd), the anus (pãyu), and the \ngenitals (upastha) – is to connect themselves in their respective \nvishays. \n \n12.14 “Shabda is the indicator of all objects.  Shabda is the cause of all social \ninteractions, and reveals the nature and class of the speaker.  It \ndwells within ãkãsh, and is also the physical element of ãkãsh, and is \nperceived by the ears. \n \n12.15 “Sparsh is the physical element of vãyu.  Softness, hardness, cold, \nheat, and perception by the skin, are the characteristics of sparsh. \n \n12.16 “Rup reveals the appearance of all objects.  It resides in all objects in a \nsmall form, and changes as objects change.  It is the physical element \nof tej, and is perceived by the eyes. \n \n12.17 “The characteristics of ras are sweetness, spiciness, distastefulness, \nbitterness, sourness, and saltiness.  It is the physical element of jal, \nand is perceived by the tongue. \n \n12.18 “The characteristics of gandh are fragrance and stench.  It is the \nphysical element of pruthvi, and is perceived by the nose. \n \n12.19 “Pruthvi supports all jeevs, and in the form of a physical body, the \npruthvi is their home.  It separates the other four bhuts, and gives a \nphysical form to all life-forms. \n12.20 “Jal binds pruthvi and other substances, and it also softens and \nmoistens all objects.  It satisfies and sustains all life-forms, it \nquenches thirst, and suppresses heat. \n \n12.21 “Tej is luminosity, the cause of the digestion of food and absorbs \nliquids.  It eliminates cold, is the cause of drying, creates hunger and \nthirst, and is the cause of burning wood and ghee. \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 38 - \n12.22 “Vãyu causes trees to shake, and it gathers leaves and other small \nobjects.  It also carries the five vishays – shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and \ngandh – to their indriyas.  It is the vital force of all the indriyas. \n \n12.23 “Ãkãsh provides space for all jeevs, and is the cause of the internal \nand external activities of the bodies.  It is also where the prãns, \nindriyas, and antah-karans reside. \n \n12.24 “In this way, by knowing the characteristics of the twenty-four \ntattvas, Prakruti, Purush, and Kãl, a person is freed from ignorance.  \nIn addition to knowing the characteristics, a person should also know \nthe process of their creation. \n \n12.25 “While residing in His dhãm, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn impregnates the \nwomb of Mãyã through Akshar-Purush, through whom countless \nmillions of Pradhãn and Purush are produced.  What are those \nPradhãn-Purush pairs like?  Well, they are the cause of the creation of \ncountless millions of brahmãnds.  Of these, I shall now tell you about \none Pradhãn-Purush pair – the cause of the creation of one brahmãnd. \n \n12.26 “Firstly, Purushottam Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, in the form of Purush, \nimpregnated the womb of Pradhãn.  From the Pradhãn, maha-tattva \nevolved.  From maha-tattva, the three types of ahankãr evolved.  Of \nthese, from sãttvik-ahankãr, the man and the presiding devs of the \nindriyas evolved; from rãjas-ahankãr, the ten indriyas, the buddhi, \nand the prãns evolved; and from tãmas-ahankãr, the five bhuts and \nthe five tanmãtras evolved.  These tattvas were created in this way. \n \n12.27 “Then, inspired by the will of Bhagvãn, each tattva with its own \ncomponents, helped create the bodies of the ishvars and the jeevs.  A \nparticular ishvar’s bodies are known as virãt, sutrãtmã, and avyãkrut.  \nA particular jeev’s bodies are known as sthul, sukshma, and kãran. \n \n12.28 “The body of ishvar, called virãt, has a lifespan of two parãrdhs.  \nFourteen manvantars pass, during one of Virãt-Purush’s days, and his \nGADHADÃ I \n- 39 - \nnight is the same duration as the day.  During his day, the lower ten \nloks of the brahmãnd remain in existence; and after his night falls, \nthey are destroyed.  This is called nimit-pralay. \n \n12.29 “When the two parãrdhs of Virãt-Purush have passed, the body of \nVirãt is destroyed, along with Satya-Lok and the other loks.  At that \ntime, Pradhãn-Prakruti, Purush, and the twenty-four tattvas, \nincluding maha-tattva, are absorbed back onto Mahã-Mãyã.  This is \ncalled prãkrut-pralay. \n \n12.30 “When that Mahã-Mãyã is absorbed by the divine light of Akshar-\nBrahm – like the night merges into the day – it is called ãtyantik-\npralay.  Also, the day-to-day death of the bodies of individual devs, \ndemons, and humans, is called nitya-pralay. \n \n12.31 “In this way, by knowing the process of the creation, sustenance, and \ndestruction, a person develops vairãgya towards the world, and \nbhakti towards Bhagvãn.  Also, when all of those brahmãnds are \ndestroyed, all other jeevs lie dormant within Mãyã, whereas the \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn attain the dhãm of Bhagvãn.” \n \n12.32 Again Muktãnand Swãmi enquired, “What is the dhãm of Bhagvãn \nlike?” \n \n12.33 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The dhãm of Bhagvãn is without a \nbeginning and without an end.  It is infinite, indivisible, divya and \nsachidãnand.  I shall describe it using an analogy. \n \n12.34 “Imagine that this whole world, with all the mountains, trees, \nhumans, animals, and all other life-forms, is made of glass.  Also, \nimagine that all the stars in the sky are as bright as the sun.  Then, \njust as the glass world would glow with extreme beauty amidst this \nradiance, the dhãm of Bhagvãn is similarly beautiful.  Bhaktas of \nBhagvãn see this in samãdhi and attain that luminous dhãm after \ndeath.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 12 || 12 || \nGADHADÃ I \n- 40 -",

    "content": "How Many Jeevs Are Within Each Body? \n \n13.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Mãgshar vad 1 [2nd December, 1819], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead under the neem \ntree near the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan, in Dãdã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a red survãl and a red dagli.  He \nhad tied a golden shelu around His head, and another golden shelu \nwas tied around His waist.  Pearl necklaces hung around His neck, \nand tassels of pearls were dangling from His pãgh.  A sabhã of munis, \nas well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n13.2 Then, Nityãnand Swãmi asked, “Within each body, is there only one \njeev, or many?  If you say there is only one jeev, then when the \nbranches of a banyan, a pipal, or other trees are cut and planted \nelsewhere, exactly the same type of trees grows there as well.  Has \nthat one jeev been dissected into two, or has another jeev entered the \nnew tree?  If you say it is the same jeev, then how has a jeev been \ndivided?  A jeev is said to be whole and indivisible.” \n \n13.3 Hearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “I shall answer the question.  \nPurush and Prakruti are the two powers of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn.  \nHe is the cause of the creation, sustenance, and destruction of this \nuniverse.  Through His two powers of Purush and Prakruti, He \nassumed the form of Virãt.  Then, during the first brãhm-kalp, \nBhagvãn gave all beings, from Brahmã to the smallest blade of grass \ntheir bodies, through His own body in the form of Virãt. \n \n13.4 “Then, during the pãdma-kalp, Bhagvãn gave Marichi and others their \nrespective bodies, through the form of Brahmã.  Then, through \nKashyap and Daksh, He gave the devs, demons, humans, animals, and \nall the sthãvar and jangam life-forms, their bodies.  That Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn, along with His powers in the form of Purush and \nPrakruti, resides as antaryãmi in all jeevs, and grants each jeev a body \naccording to its past karmas. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 41 - \n13.5 “That jeev, in its past lives, has performed many karmas – some with \nsattva-gun predominating, some with rajo-gun predominating, and \nsome with tamo-gun predominating.  As a consequence of those \nkarmas, Bhagvãn grants that jeev a body of the udbhij type, or the \njarãyuj type, or the svedaj type, or the andaj type.  Bhagvãn also \ngrants the jeev the rewards of its karmas in the form of happiness and \nmisery. \n \n13.6 “In addition, Bhagvãn makes the body of that jeev give birth to \nanother body, according to its own karmas.  Just as Bhagvãn created \nvarious life-forms from the bodies of Kashyap and the prajãpatis, that \nsame Bhagvãn, while residing in all jeevs as antaryãmi, creates other \nbodies from one body by methods appropriate to that particular \nbody.  However, the jeev, through which other bodies are created, \ndoes not itself multiply into many forms.  Bhagvãn grants birth to a \njeev, through the body of another jeev, according to the relation of the \nkarmas between the two jeevs.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 13 || 13 ||",

    "content": "Grahastha And Sant \nQualities Of A Dãs Of Bhagvãn \n \n14.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Mãgshar vad 2, [3rd December, 1819], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead under the neem tree opposite the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-\nNãrãyan, facing south, in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He had \ntied a white pãgh around His head.  He was also wearing a white khes, \nand had covered Himself with a chãdar.  Also, tassels of yellow \nflowers decorated His pãgh.  Bunches of yellow flowers had been \nplaced above both of His ears, with roses decorating those bunches.  \nHe was wearing garlands of yellow flowers around His neck.  With \nGADHADÃ I \n- 42 - \nHis right hand, He was playing with a white sevati flower.  A sabhã of \nmunis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n14.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then asked the munis, “Suppose there are two \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn.  One is a tyãgi, and has abandoned worldly life.  \nAlthough he does not have intense vairãgya, he physically abides by \nthe vartmãns thoroughly.  However, he still has a slight desire for \nworldly life in his mind, but he overcomes this by a thought process.  \nHe also has firm nishchay in Bhagvãn.  Such is the tyãgi.  In contrast, \nthere is another bhakta, a grahastha.  He also has firm nishchay in \nBhagvãn.  Even though he has remained a grahastha by Bhagvãn’s \nãgnã, he is disinterested in worldly life.  He has the same intensity of \nworldly desires as the tyãgi.  Of these two bhaktas of Bhagvãn, who is \nbetter?” \n \n14.3 Muktãnand Swãmi replied, “The tyãgi bhakta is better.” \n \n14.4 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The tyãgi abandoned worldly of his own \naccord, out of frustration – so how can he be better?  On the other \nhand, the grahastha has stayed at home because of Bhagvãn’s ãgnã – \nso how can he be inferior?” \n \n14.5 Muktãnand Swãmi attempted to answer Shreeji Mahãrãj’s question \nin many ways, but was unable to give a satisfactory response.  Then, \nhe said, “Mahãrãj, please answer the question yourself.” \n \n14.6 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “If a tyãgi who is weak-minded receives \nrich foods to eat, then desires for worldly life will be revived within \nhis heart.  Or, if he encounters many hardships, the desires for \nworldly life will be revived.  Compared to such a tyãgi, a grahastha is \nmuch better, because whenever a grahastha encounters times of \nextreme hardship or even times of great pleasure, he is always \ncautious, just in case he becomes attached to these pleasures.  With \nGADHADÃ I \n- 43 - \nthis awareness, he remains disinterested in worldly life.  Therefore, a \ntrue tyãgi is a person who has no desires for worldly life after he has \nabandoned it. \n \n14.7 “But keep in mind that a grahastha is much better than a tyãgi with \nworldly desires, only if he follows the dharma prescribed for \ngrahasthas.  The grahastha’s dharma is extremely difficult to follow \nbecause countless occasions of good and bad times are encountered.  \nDespite this, a true grahastha’s mind does not waver from serving \nsant or from following his dharma.  He also realises ‘The profound \nassociation of the sant that I have attained is like a magnificent \nchintãmani and a kalp-vruksh.  My wealth, property, sons, and \ndaughters, are merely like a dream.  The deep association of the sant \nthat I have attained is the only true benefit of life’.  Moreover, he does \nnot become disheartened amidst any type of hardship that may come \nhis way.  Such a grahastha is by far the better of the two.  Therefore, \nof all things, becoming a bhakta of Bhagvãn is very difficult; and to \nattain the association of the bhaktas of Bhagvãn is very rare indeed.” \n \n14.8 Having spoken in this way, Shreeji Mahãrãj then arranged for the \nsinging of kirtans written by Muktãnand Swãmi. \n \n14.9 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “The Shrutis state: \n \nante yã matihi sã gatihi \nWhatever a person’s mental state is like at the time of his death, \nwill also be the state of his jeev after his death. \n \n“If a person’s mind is fixed on Bhagvãn at the time of death, he will \nattain a pleasant fate after death.  Otherwise, he will not.  This is the \ninterpretation of the Vedic shlok.  If this is so, then what is the \nsignificance of the bhakti a person has performed throughout his \nlife?” \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 44 - \n14.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “A person who has been graced with \npratyaksha Bhagvãn, never falls from the path of kalyãn, regardless of \nwhether or not he is conscious and aware of his physical body at the \ntime of death.  He is protected by Bhagvãn. \n \n14.11 “Conversely, a person who has turned away from Bhagvãn, does not \nattain kalyãn when he leaves his physical body, even if he is \nconscious.  Instead, he is sent to Yampuri after death.  There are \nmany sinful butchers who die while still fully conscious and aware of \ntheir body.  Will they attain kalyãn?  Of course not.  If a bhakta of \nBhagvãn suffers an accidental death and does not remember \nBhagvãn, he will still attain kalyãn. \n \n14.12 “Therefore, that Vedic shlok should be interpreted as follows: ‘The \noutcome at the time of death is determined by the present state of \nmind’.  Therefore, a bhakta who realises in his mind ‘My kalyãn is \nguaranteed’ will as a result certainly attain kalyãn after death.  In \ncomparison, a person who has not been graced with the company of \na sant or the svarup of Bhagvãn, will feel in his mind ‘I am ignorant, \nand I will not attain kalyãn’.  As a result, his state of mind will \ndetermine his fate after death.  \n \n14.13 “A person who is the dãs of Bhagvãn has nothing left to do.  In fact, \nother jeevs attain kalyãn by his darshan, so what is surprising about \nhim attaining kalyãn?  But to develop servitude towards Bhagvãn is \nvery difficult indeed.  This is because a dãs of Bhagvãn has the \nfollowing characteristics: he realises the physical body as asatya, and \nhis own ãtmã as satya.  He has no desires to indulge in objects that \nare intended for his master.  Also, he never behaves against the \nwishes of his master.  Such a person is called a true dãs of Bhagvãn.  \nHowever, a dãs of Bhagvãn who behaves as the body, is a false \nbhakta.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 14 || 14 || \nGADHADÃ I \n- 45 -",

    "content": "Not Becoming Discouraged In Dhyãn \n \n15.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Mãgshar vad 3 [4th December, 1819], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n15.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “A person whose heart is filled with bhakti \ntowards Bhagvãn, feels ‘I only want to act according to the ãgnã of \nBhagvãn and His sant’.  This is the spirit within his heart.  Also, he \nnever – not even by mistake – utters ‘I will only be able to follow \ncertain ãgnã, but not others’. \n \n15.3 “Furthermore, such a person remains determined to see the \nBhagvãn’s murti in his heart.  If, while performing dhyãn on that \nmurti, it cannot be seen, he does not lose courage.  Instead, he \nconstantly maintains a new shraddhã.  While trying to see that murti, \ndisturbing thoughts may arise, and despite his best efforts, they may \nnot be suppressed.  However, these disturbing thoughts can be \novercome.  The murti of Bhagvãn can then be seen within the heart \nby understanding the immense glory of Bhagvãn and by believing \nhimself to be completely fulfilled.  Even if this process takes ten \nyears, twenty years, twenty-five years, or even a hundred years, he \nstill does not become discouraged.  He never abandon’s his attempts \nat seeing the murti of Bhagvãn within his heart.  After all, Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn has mentioned in the Geetã: \n \nanek-janma-sansiddh-stato yãti parãm gatim \nA yogi who has become siddh after many lives, attains Akshardhãm. \n \n15.4 “Therefore, a person who continues to try and see Bhagvãn in this \nway, is called an ekãntik bhakta.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 15 || 15 || \nGADHADÃ I \n- 46 -",

    "content": "Wisdom \n \n16.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Mãgshar vad 4 [5th December, 1819], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n16.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A wise bhakta of Bhagvãn, who can \ndistinguish between sat and asat, perceives the avgun within himself \nand thoughtfully eradicates them.  He also rejects any apparent \navgun he perceives in a sant or a satsangi, and perceives their gun.  \nMoreover, he never sees avgun in Bhagvãn.  In addition, he accepts as \nthe highest truth, whatever words of advice Bhagvãn and a sant offer \nand does not doubt their words in any way.  Therefore, when a sant \ntells him ‘You are distinct from the mind, body, indriyas, and prãns; you \nare satya; you are the knower of the body, indriyas, and prãns, which \nare all asatya’ he accepts this to be the truth.  He then behaves as the \nãtmã – distinct from them all – and never follows the instincts of his \nown mind. \n \n16.3 “In addition, such a person perceives objects and kusang that may \ncause bondage, or raise deficiencies in the ekãntik dharma, and \navoids them.  He does not become bound by them.  Also, he takes in \nthoughts that are positive, and avoids thoughts that are negative.  A \nperson, who behaves in this way, is known to possess wisdom.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 16 || 16 ||",

    "content": "Negative Influence In Satsang \nNever Speak Discouraging Words \n \n17.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Mãgshar vad 5 [6th December, 1819], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in a west-facing room of Dãdã Khãchar’s \nGADHADÃ I \n- 47 - \ndarbãr in Gadhadã, while the kathã was being read.  He was wearing \na white khes, and had covered Himself with a chãdar.  He had tied a \nwhite pãgh around His head, with a tassel of yellow flowers inserted \ninto the pãgh, and He was wearing a garland of yellow flowers.  He \nwas in a very pleasant mood. \n \n17.2 At that time, Shreeji Mahãrãj called for Muktãnand Swãmi, \nGopãlãnand Swãmi and some other sãdhus.  Addressing them, Shreeji \nMahãrãj said, “A small element of negative influence still remains in \nour satsang, which I wish to eliminate today.  I want to conduct this \nmatter in a way that includes all satsangis, paramhans, sãnkhya-yogis, \nand karma-yogis. \n \n17.3 “Now, what is this negative influence in satsang?  Well, it is those who \nspeak discouragingly about satsang.  That is the negative influence in \nsatsang.  What do they say?  They say, ‘Who can follow Bhagvãn’s \nãgnã thoroughly?  Who can possibly follow the vartmãns perfectly?  No \none.  Therefore, we should follow only as much as we can.  After all, \nBhagvãn is adham-udhãran, and so He will grant kalyãn to us as well’. \n \n17.4 “They also say, ‘Attempting to see Bhagvãn’s svarup in the heart is not \npossible by a person’s own efforts.  It is only seen by those whom \nBhagvãn helps out of compassion’.  With such proud words, they \ndiscourage others from practicing dharma, gnãn, vairãgya, bhakti, \nand other spiritual activities that please Bhagvãn. \n \n17.5 “Therefore, from this day onwards, no one in our satsang should ever \nutter such discouraging words.  Instead, always speak with courage.  \nThose who do speak such words should be known as napunsak.  In \nfact, on days when a person speaks such discouraging words, he \nshould keep an upvãs.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 17 || 17 || \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 48 -",

    "content": "Denouncing The Panch-Vishays \n \n18.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Mãgshar vad 6 [7th December 1819], \nthree hours before sunrise, Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was \nsitting on a decorated bedstead, in the courtyard in front of the \nveranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes. \n \n18.2 After calling the paramhans and satsangis, Shreeji Mahãrãj sat \nengrossed in thought for quite some time.  Then, He said, “I wish to \ntell all of you something, so please listen.”  He then said, “In my mind \nI feel that I should not talk about this matter.  However, I have the \nunderstanding that you are all mine, so I shall tell you.  The matter is \nsuch that only a person who understands it and acts exactly \naccording to it, will become a mukta.  Otherwise, even by listening to \nor studying and understanding the meanings of the four Veds, six \nshãstras, eighteen Purãns, and the Mahãbhãrat and other historical \nshãstras, a person cannot become a mukta.  I shall now talk about the \nmatter, so please listen.  \n \n18.3 “Regardless of the attractive objects which may appear before me, if \nthere is no desire for them in my mind, I am not worried.  Also, my \nnature is such that even if the slightest desire of an object were to \narise within me, I only feel at ease after shunning it. \n \n18.4 “For this reason, I thought about what actually causes disturbances \nwithin the hearts of Bhagvãn’s bhaktas.  I considered the man, buddhi, \nchitt, and ahankãr as possible causes.  However, the antah-karans are \nnot the cause of these disturbances.  The only fault of the antah-\nkarans is the satisfaction that it has, due to either the power of its \nnishchay in Bhagvãn or the strength derived from knowledge of the \nãtmã.  Due to this satisfaction, it feels, ‘I have found Bhagvãn, and so I \nhave nothing left to do’. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 49 - \n18.5 “Actually, the greater fault lies with the five gnãn-indriyas, which I \nshall now elaborate in detail.  Of the many varieties of foods that a \nperson eats, each has differing tastes and differing natural qualities.  \nWhen he eats that food, the natural qualities of the food pervade and \naffect the antah-karans as well as the entire body.  For example, even \na bhakta of Bhagvãn, after drinking bhãng, loses awareness of his \nvartmãns and the worship of Bhagvãn, due to the stimulation caused \nby that bhãng.  Similarly, the natural qualities of the countless types \nof food are of a countless variety, like bhãng.  So much so, that they \nseem endless. \n \n18.6 “In the same way, a person also hears a countless variety of sounds \nwith his ears.  Those sounds also have a countless variety of natural \nqualities.  Consequently, the qualities of whatever sounds he listens \nto, pervade and affect his antah-karans.  For example, there may be \nan armed and violent person, an adulterous person, a prostitute, or a \nperson who disobeys the rules of the Veds and society.  Listening to \nthe talks of such vicious persons is like drinking bhãng or alcohol – \nsuch talks pollute the antah-karans of the listener and make him \nforget the worship of Bhagvãn and His vartmãns. \n \n18.7 “Similarly, there are countless varieties of touch sensations.  They too \nhave countless varieties of natural qualities.  The touch of a sinful \nperson also has an effect like that of bhãng and alcohol.  Therefore, \neven if a bhakta touched such a person, that bhakta will lose all of his \ngun. \n \n18.8 “There are also countless varieties of things to see.  They too have \ncountless varieties of natural qualities.  If a person looks at an \nimmoral person, the effect is just as damaging as drinking bhãng or \nalcohol.  Therefore, looking at an immoral person definitely pollutes \nhis mind and causes harm. \n \n18.9 “In the same way, there are countless varieties of smells, with \ncountless varieties of natural qualities.  If a person smells the \nGADHADÃ I \n- 50 - \nfragrance of a flower or some sandalwood paste from the hands of a \nsinful person, it pollutes his mind in the same way as drinking bhãng. \n \n18.10 “Conversely, just as the mind is polluted by association with an \nimmoral person, association of Bhagvãn or His sant purifies the mind.  \nEven if the mind is polluted, it is purified by listening to the words of \nBhagvãn and His sant.  The mind is similarly purified by their touch.  \nHowever, if a person is unable to touch such a great sant due to the \nrestrictions of his vartmãns, then merely touching the dust of his holy \nfeet to his head makes him pure.  Likewise, a person is purified by the \ndarshan of a great sant.  However, he should have darshan while \nrespecting his vartmãns.  A person is also purified by eating prasãd, \nbut the prasãd should be taken in accordance with the niyams of his \nvarna and ãshram as set by Bhagvãn.  If a person is unable to take \nprasãd, he should offer sãkar and take that as prasãd.  In the same \nway, smelling the fragrance of the flowers and sandalwood paste \noffered to the great sant also purifies the mind. \n \n18.11 “On the other hand, if a person indulges in the five vishays \nthoughtlessly, without distinguishing good from bad, then even if he \nis great as Nãrad and the Sanakãdik, his mind will surely become \npolluted.  What is so surprising about the mind of a person who \nbelieves himself to be the body becoming polluted?  Therefore, if he \ngives freedom to the five indriyas without understanding the \ndifference between suitable and unsuitable, his antah-karans will \nbecome polluted.  On the other hand, if a person indulges only in pure \nvishays through the five indriyas, then his antah-karans become pure.  \nIf the antah-karans become pure, he will be able to constantly \nremember Bhagvãn. \n \n18.12 “However, if the objects of indulgence of even just one of the five \nindriyas are impure, the antah-karans will also become impure.  \nTherefore, the sole cause of any disturbance experienced by a bhakta \nof Bhagvãn during worship is the vishays of the five indriyas, not the \nantah-karan.   \nGADHADÃ I \n- 51 - \n18.13 “Another factor that determines the nature of a person’s antah-\nkarans is the type of company he keeps.  If he sits in a sabhã of \nmaterialistic people in a lavish seven-storey mansion decorated with \nbeautiful mirrors and comfortable seats, and if those materialistic \npeople are seated wearing various types of jewellery and fine clothes, \nand they are exchanging alcohol amongst themselves, with \nprostitutes performing vulgar dances to the accompaniment of \nvarious musical instruments – then the person’s antah-karans will \nunquestionably be harmfully affected.  On the other hand, if a person \nsits in a sabhã where a paramhans is seated on a torn mattress in a \ngrass hut and talks of Bhagvãn, dharma, gnãn, vairãgya and bhakti \nare in progress – then the person’s antah-karans will surely be \nfavourably affected. \n \n18.14 “Therefore, if a person thoughtfully examines the influence of satsang \nand kusang on the antah-karans, their effects can be realised.  \nHowever, a fool cannot realise this.  Indeed, this fact will not be \nunderstood by those who behave irresponsibly like animals.  In \ncomparison, a person who has even a little wisdom and has sought at \nleast some refuge in Bhagvãn will immediately understand.  \nTherefore, all paramhans, sãnkhya-yogis and karma-yogis should not \nassociate with evil people. \n \n18.15 “Regardless of how evil a person may be before joining the satsang, \nhe should be accepted into satsang after he takes the appropriate \nniyams.  However, if after joining the satsang, that person retains his \nevil nature, he or she should be removed from satsang.  If he or she is \nnot removed, then great harm will result.  For example, if a person’s \nfinger is bitten by a snake, or if it develops gangrene, and if the \naffected part is not immediately removed, the results would be \ndamaging.  Similarly, if a person is recognised as evil, you should \nimmediately shun him. \n \n18.16 “In conclusion, remain wise enough to accept these words of mine.  If \nyou do so, I shall consider it to be equivalent to you having served me \nGADHADÃ I \n- 52 - \nin every way.  I will also bless all of you and be extremely pleased \nwith you.  This is because you will have justified my efforts.  \nMoreover, all of us will stay together in the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  \nHowever, if you do not behave in this way, we will be greatly \ndistanced.  Consequently, you will reborn as a ghost or a demon, and \nyou will have to suffer.  Of course, the fruits of whatever bhakti you \nmay have previously offered to Bhagvãn will be rewarded eventually, \nbut only after great misery.  Even then, you will become a mukta and \ngo to Akshardhãm only by behaving as I have described.   \n \n18.17 “Furthermore, if anyone attempts to imitate me, he will definitely \nsuffer.  This is because Nar-Nãrãyan resides within my heart.  \nMoreover, I am an eternal mukta.  I have not become a mukta through \nthe preaching of others.  I exercise complete control over my man, \nbuddhi, chitt, and ahankãr.  In fact, I seize my antah-karans just as a \nlion clutches a goat, whereas others cannot even see their antah-\nkarans.  Therefore, imitating me, and believing that a person can \nremain pure even amidst attractive pleasures is just not possible, \neven for the likes of Nãrad and the Sanakãdik.  So what can be said of \nothers? \n \n18.18 “A countless number have become muktas, and countless more will \nbecome muktas.  Amongst them, none have been able to indulge in \npleasures of the senses and yet remain uninfluenced by them; none \nwill be able to do so in the future; nor is there anyone like that \npresently.  Even a person who has made an effort for countless \nmillions of years is incapable of remaining uninfluenced amidst \ntemptations.  Therefore, if you behave as I have described, you will \nbenefit.” \n \n18.19 Continuing, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “When I lovingly call someone near, \nit is for the benefit of their jeev.  When I look at someone lovingly, or \neat the tasty meals they have prepared, or sit on a decorated \nbedstead, or accept clothes, jewellery, garlands of flowers, and other \nofferings – it is all for the good of their  jeev, but not for the sake of \nGADHADÃ I \n- 53 - \nmy personal enjoyment.  In fact, I vow on Rãmãnand Swãmi that I do \nnot accept those objects for my personal pleasure.  Therefore, \nrealising this, none of you should imitate me.  \n \n18.20 “Also, keep the activities of your five indriyas extremely pure.  Please \naccept this ãgnã of mine without fail.  This fact is simple in that it is \ncomprehensible to all; so all of you will immediately understand it.  \nMoreover, if you extensively announce it throughout satsang, I shall \nbe very pleased indeed.” \n \n18.21 Having delivered this talk, Shreeji Mahãrãj bid “Jay Sachidãnand” to \nall and returned to His residence. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 18 || 18 ||",

    "content": "Ãtmã-Nishthã, Bhakti, Vairãgya, And Svadharma \n \n19.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Posh sud 1 [18th \nDecember, 1819], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A \nsabhã of paramhans, as well as and haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n19.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “In this satsang, those bhaktas who seek \ntheir own ãtyantik kalyãn cannot fulfil that aim by ãtmã-nishthã \nalone; nor can they fulfil that aim by lovingly offering the nine types \nof bhakti alone; nor can they fulfil that aim by vairãgya alone; nor can \nthey fulfil that aim by svadharma alone.  Therefore, all four qualties – \nãtmã-nishthã, bhakti, vairãgya, and svadharma – should be perfected \nsince all are dependent upon each other.  Now, please listen as I \ndescribe how these four qualities are interdependent. \n \n19.3 “If a person has ãtmã-nishthã, but does not have love towards \nBhagvãn, then he does not attain the compassion of Bhagvãn, which \ncan only be attained by love.  Such compassion results in the \nGADHADÃ I \n- 54 - \nachievement of the desirable and great divine power of not being \noverpowered by the gun of Mãyã.  On the other hand, if a person does \nhave love for Bhagvãn, but has not attained ãtmã-nishthã, then due to \nthe belief that he is the body, that love cannot be perfected.  Also, a \nperson may have both ãtmã-nishthã and love for Bhagvãn, but if he \nlacks firm vairãgya, then the desires for worldly five vishays will \nprevent the perfection of ãtmã-nishthã and love for Bhagvãn.  \n \n19.4 “Then again, a person may have vairãgya, but if he lacks ãtmã-nishthã \nand love for Bhagvãn, he does not experience the profound bliss \nassociated with the svarup of Bhagvãn.  Also, a person may have \nsvadharma, but if love for Bhagvãn, ãtmã-nishthã and vairãgya are \nabsent, then he will not be able to rise above Bhur-Lok, Bhuvar-Lok, \nand all the other loks up to Brahmã’s Svarg-Lok.  That is to say, he will \nnot be able to rise above the brahmãnds and attain Bhagvãn’s \nAkshardhãm, which is greater than the darkness of Mãyã.  On the \nother hand, a person may have the three qualities of ãtmã-nishthã, \nlove for Bhagvãn, and vairãgya; but if svadharma is lacking, the three \ncannot be perfected. \n \n19.5 “In this way, ãtmã-nishthã and other three qualities are dependent \nupon each other.  A bhakta, who has extremely firmly established \nthese four qualities within himself through the profound association \nwith Bhagvãn’s ekãntik bhaktas, has completed all spiritual activities.  \nOnly he should be known as an ekãntik bhakta.  Therefore, a bhakta \nhaving any deficiency in these four qualities should overcome that \ndeficiency by serving and profoundly associating with the ekãntik \nbhakta of Bhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 19 || 19 ||",

    "content": "An Ignorant Person Does Not See His Own Svarup \n \n20.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Posh sud 2 [19th December, 1819], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was seated on a decorated bedstead on the veranda \nGADHADÃ I \n- 55 - \noutside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  \nHe had tied a white pãgh around His head, and a tassel of yellow \nflowers had been placed in the pãgh.  A garland of yellow flowers had \nbeen placed around His neck, and bunches of white and yellow \nflowers had been placed above His ears.  He had also covered Himself \nwith a white chofãl and was wearing a khes with a black border.  The \nkathã was being read.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n20.2 Then, Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj said, “Please listen, I wish \nto ask all of you a question.” \n \n20.3 Hearing this, all the haribhaktas said with folded hands, “Please do \nask.” \n \n20.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then asked, “Who is the most ignorant of all ignorant \npeople?” \n \n20.5 Everyone pondered over the question, but no one was able to reply.  \nSo, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Here, I shall answer myself.” \n \n20.6 Hearing this, everyone was pleased and said, “Mahãrãj, only you will \nbe able to give a precise answer, so please explain.” \n \n20.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj then began, “The jeev, which resides within the body, \nobserves both the attractive and the unattractive.  It witnesses \nchildhood, youth, and old age, as well as a countless number of other \nthings.  However, the observer (jeev) fails to observe its own svarup.  \nThe jeev looks at objects externally, but it does not look at its own \nsvarup.  Therefore, it is the most ignorant of the ignorant. \n    \n20.8 “Furthermore, just as the jeev indulges in a countless variety of sights \nwith the eyes, it similarly indulges in and knows the pleasures of the \nother vishays with the ears, skin, tongue, and nose.  However, it does \nnot indulge in the bliss of its own svarup and nor does it know its \nown nature.  For this reason, it is the most ignorant of the ignorant, \nGADHADÃ I \n- 56 - \nthe most senseless of the senseless, the most foolish of fools, and the \nvilest of the vile.” \n \n20.9 At that point, Shuk Muni raised a doubt.  He asked, “Is it truly in a \nperson’s own hands to see his own svarup?  If it is, why does the jeev \nremain ignorant?” \n \n20.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “For a person who has attained satsang, \ndarshan of his jeevãtmã lies in his own hands.  In fact, when has he \nattempted to see his own svarup and failed to see it?  Having become \ndependent on and made helpless by mãyã, that jeev draws within, \nand enters the svapna and sushupti states, but never does it draw \nwithin of its own accord to see its own svarup.  On the other hand, a \nperson who thinks about the greatness of Bhagvãn and draws within \nhimself sees his own svarup as extremely pure and luminous.  In the \nmidst of the luminance, he beholds the murti of Purushottam \nBhagvãn, and experiences bliss in the way of Nãrad and the \nSanakãdik.  Therefore, all deficiencies in a bhakta are due to his own \nlaziness.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 20 || 20 ||",

    "content": "Svadharma \nThe Two Forms Of Akshar \n \n21.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Posh sud 3 [19th \nDecember, 1819], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a khes with a black \nborder, and had covered Himself with a white cotton cloth.  He had \nalso tied a white pãgh around His head.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.  Some of \nthe sãdhus were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a jhãnjh and \npakhvãj. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 57 - \n21.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj quietened the sabhã and said, “Please listen, I wish to \ntell you something.”  Having said this, He sat in deep thought with His \neyes closed for quite some time. \n \n21.3 Then, He said, “A haribhakta, who in his mind desires to intensely \nplease Bhagvãn, can do so by the following means: unshakeable \ndetermination in abiding by the dharma of his varna and ãshram; \nfirm ãtmã-nishthã; dislike for all objects except Bhagvãn; and bhakti \nwhich is without any desires for rewards, and which is accompanied \nwith an understanding of Bhagvãn’s greatness.  Bhagvãn is extremely \npleased by these four spiritual activities.  These spiritual activities \nare collectively known as ekãntik dharma.  At present, there are \nmany bhaktas in our satsang, who possess ekãntik dharma. \n \n21.4 “A bhakta of Bhagvãn should think of the murti of Bhagvãn while \neating, drinking, bathing, washing, walking, sitting, and all other \nactivities.  He should particularly think of Bhagvãn and continuously \nthink of His murti when there is no mental disturbance within.  \nHowever, when there is some internal disturbance due to random \nthoughts, he should realise his own self to be distinct from the body, \nthe indriyas, the antah-karans, and the vishays, and their presiding \ndevs.  Only when those disturbing thoughts diminish, should he think \nof the murti of Bhagvãn. \n \n21.5 “The body should not be believed to be a person’s true self, nor \nshould a person’s bodily relations be regarded as his true relations.  \nThis is because the jeev has previously taken birth in each of the 8.4 \nmillion life-forms.  In fact, the jeev has taken birth in the wombs of all \nfemales in this world; it has also taken birth numerous times in the \nwombs of all the dogs, cats, monkeys, and other types of life-forms in \nthe cycle of 8.4 million life-forms.  Also, of all the different types of \nfemales in this world, which has it not previously made its wife?  All \nhave been its wife at one time or another.  Similarly, with numerous \nfemale bodies, that jeev has also made all the different forms of \nmales, its husband. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 58 - \n21.6 “Therefore, just as a person does not believe the relations of those \nprevious 8.4 million life-forms to be his true relations, and just as he \ndoes not believe the bodies of those 8.4 million to be his true \nrelations, and just as he does not believe the bodies of those 8.4 \nmillion life-forms to be his true body, in the same way, a person \nshould not believe this present body to be his true self, nor should he \nbelieve the relations of this body to be his true relations. \n \n21.7 “Therefore, a person should offer bhakti to Bhagvãn day by day, and \nshould also constantly keep the company of a sãdhu, while regarding \nall possessions and all objects as asatya, while having realised \nhimself to be distinct from the body, indriyas, and antah-karans, and \nwhile following his own dharma. \n \n21.8 “A person who does not have this understanding – who identifies \nhimself with the body, and who has an ordinary attitude – should be \nthought of as an animal, even if he is presently in satsang.  Yet, in this \nsatsang, even animals attain kalyãn by the intense grace of Bhagvãn.  \nSo, what is so special about humans attaining kalyãn?  However, such \na person cannot be called a true ekãntik bhakta of Bhagvãn.  Only a \nperson possessing the understanding previously described can be \ncalled an ekãntik bhakta.  After such an ekãntik bhakta leaves his \nbody and becomes free of all influences of mãyã, he attains \nAkshardhãm via the archimãrg. \n \n21.9 “Akshar has two forms.  One, which is formless and pure chaitanya, is \nknown as Chidãkãsh or Brahm-Mahol.  In its other form, Akshar \nremains in the sevã of Purushottam-Nãrãyan.  A bhakta who has \nreached Akshardhãm attains qualities similar to those of Akshar, and \nforever remains in the sevã of Bhagvãn.  Furthermore, Shree Krishna \nPurushottam-Nãrãyan is forever seated in that Akshardhãm.  The \ncountless millions of muktas, who have attained Akshardhãm, behave \nas the dãs of Bhagvãn.  Purushottam-Nãrãyan Himself is the master of \nthem all, and the master of the kings of all the countless millions of \nbrahmãnds.  \nGADHADÃ I \n- 59 - \n \n21.10 “Keeping this in mind, all of our satsangis should develop the \nfollowing singular belief:  ‘We also wish to sit beside the akshar-rup \nmuktas, and we wish to go to Akshardhãm, and forever remain in the \nsevã of Bhagvãn.  We have no desire for the temporary and mãyik \nworldly pleasures, and nor do we wish to be tempted by them in any \nway’.  Keeping such a firm belief, a person should offer ekãntik bhakti \nto Bhagvãn. \n \n21.11 “By thoroughly understanding the greatness of Bhagvãn, a person \nshould eradicate his desires for women, wealth, and all objects other \nthan Bhagvãn.  If desires for objects other than Bhagvãn are to \nremain, then if on the path to Akshardhãm he is tempted by these \nobjects, he will abandon Bhagvãn and be lured by those objects \ninstead.  This would prove to be a major disaster.  Therefore, a \nperson should worship Bhagvãn after overcoming desires for all \nobjects.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 21 || 21 ||",

    "content": "Remember Bhagvãn During All Activities \n \n22.1 In the Samvat year 1876, at noon on Posh sud 4 [20th December, \n1819], Shreeji Mahãrãj was seated on a decorated bedstead on the \nveranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A tassel of \nflowers had been inserted in His pãgh, and bunches of flowers had \nbeen placed above both of His ears.  He was also wearing a garland of \nguldãvadi flowers around His neck.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.  The \nparamhans were singing kirtans. \n \n22.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Please listen.  I wish to tell you \nsomething.” \nGADHADÃ I \n- 60 - \n \n22.3 Hearing this, the paramhans stopped singing and prepared \nthemselves to listen. \n \n22.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, “If a person does not remember Bhagvãn \nwhile singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a mrudang, a sãrangi, \na sarodã, and other musical instruments, then that singing is as good \nas not having sung at all.  There are many people in the world who \nsing and play instruments without remembering Bhagvãn, but they \ndo not attain peace of mind.  Therefore, whichever activity a person \nperforms – whether it is singing kirtans, reciting Bhagvãn’s name, or \nsinging the Nãrãyan dhun, – he should only perform that activity \nwhile remembering the murti of Bhagvãn. \n \n22.5 “If a person specifically attempts to engage himself in bhajan, he may \nonly be able to focus his vrutti on Bhagvãn.  However, after \ncompleting those acts of bhajan if he does not keep vrutti in Bhagvãn \nwhile performing daily duties, his vrutti will not be steady on the \nmurti of Bhagvãn even if he attempts to engage in bhajan again.  \nTherefore, a person should practice maintaining his vrutti on the \nsvarup of Bhagvãn while walking, eating, and drinking – in fact, \nduring all activities.  If he does this, his vrutti becomes fixed on \nBhagvãn when he engages in bhajan as well.  Moreover, when his \nvrutti begins to remain on Bhagvãn, it remains so even during other \nwork.  If a person is stupid and ignorant, then he will not be able to \nkeep vrutti in Bhagvãn, even when he does bhajan.  Therefore, a \nbhakta of Bhagvãn should carefully practice maintaining his vrutti on \nthe murti of Bhagvãn.” \n \n22.6 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj requested, “Now please sing \nkirtans.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 22 || 22 || \n \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 61 -",

    "content": "The Nature Of A Bhakta With Strong Sthiti \n \n23.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Posh sud 5 [21st December, 1819], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda \noutside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  \nHe had tied a white feto around His head and was wearing a white \nangarkhu and white survãl.  He had also tied a deep orange shelu \naround His waist.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as satsangis from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n23.2 Out of compassion, Shreeji Mahãrãj then began to speak to the \nparamhans, “The Vãsudev Mahãtmya shãstra is extremely dear to me, \nas it describes all the methods of how bhaktas of Bhagvãn should \nworship Him.” \n \n23.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj then continued, “There are two types of bhaktas of \nBhagvãn: One bhakta has complete nishchay in Bhagvãn, yet \nworships Bhagvãn identifying himself with the body.  The other, \nbelieves his own svarup to be chaitanya, and beyond the influence of \nthe three mental states (jãgrat, svapna, sushupti) and the three \nbodies (sthul, sukshma, and kãran).  This bhakta worships Bhagvãn \nwhile seeing Bhagvãn’s murti within his own svarup.  As a result, he \nsees his own svarup, which is beyond the three mental states and the \nthree bodies, as being extremely full of divine light.  Within that light, \nhe sees the murti of Bhagvãn, just as it is in its pratyaksha svarup, as \nbeing extremely luminous.  Such is the sthiti of this bhakta. \n \n23.4 “As long as a person has not attained this sthiti, he is subject to \nobstacles, even if he is a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  For example, Shivji did \nnot have this sthiti and was therefore enticed by the beauty of Mohini.  \nBrahmã also did not have this sthiti, and therefore became attracted \nto the svarup of Sarasvati.  Nãradji also did not have such sthiti, and \nconsequently had a desire to marry.  Others like Indra and Chandra, \nGADHADÃ I \n- 62 - \nwho were not behaving with this sthiti, also had their reputations \nblemished due to their mistakes. \n \n23.5 “Furthermore, if a person has not developed this sthiti, he will \nidentify worldly characteristics even in Bhagvãn, even if he himself is \na bhakta of Bhagvãn.  Parikshit Rãjã was not such a bhakta who had \nthis sthiti, and so he raised doubts about the divinity of Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn after hearing of the rãs-leelã.  On the other hand, because \nShukji was such an elevated bhakta, he had no doubts whatsoever.  \nSuch a bhakta firmly realises ‘If no flaws can affect me or bind me in \nany way, how can there possibly be any mãyik flaws in Bhagvãn, by \nwhose worship I have become like this?’  A bhakta with this sthiti \nfirmly realises this. \n \n23.6 “When such a bhakta of Bhagvãn focuses his vrutti on the svarup of \nBhagvãn, that vrutti is divided into two.  Of these, one vrutti focuses \non the svarup of Bhagvãn, while the other focuses within the \nworshipper himself.  The vrutti that is fixed on Bhagvãn’s svarup is \napplied lovingly, whereas the vrutti that is fixed on the worshipper \nhimself is full of thoughts.  This vrutti that is full of thoughts \nneutralises all other thoughts and desires – except those of \nworshipping Bhagvãn – that may arise in the worshipper himself.  In \nthis way, the vrutti of such a bhakta constantly remains on Bhagvãn. \n \n23.7 “A person who at times worships Bhagvãn with a concentrated mind, \nand at other times indulges in worldly thoughts, does not develop \nthis sthiti.  For example, consider a pot that is filled with water and \nemptied somewhere.  If another pot of water is subsequently \nemptied at the same place on the following day or the day after that, \na pool of water will not collect there.  This is because the water \npoured on the first day dried up on that very day, and water poured \nafter also dries up on that same day.  On the other hand, if a trickle of \nwater were to flow continuously, a large pool of water will soon be \nformed.  Therefore, while eating, drinking, walking, and engaging in \nGADHADÃ I \n- 63 - \nany activity whatsoever – whether it is pure or impure – in fact, at all \ntimes, a person should constantly keep his vrutti of Bhagvãn.  While \nmaintaining his vrutti constantly on Bhagvãn in this way, he attains \nstrong sthiti.” \n \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 23 || 23 ||",

    "content": "Sthiti Attained By Gnãn \nThe ‘Sourness’ Of Bhagvãn’s Greatness \n \n24.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Posh sud 6 [22nd \nDecember, 1819], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He had tied a white feto around His \nhead, and was wearing a white khes.  Also, He had put on a warm, red \ndagli and had covered Himself with a white chofãl.  A sabhã of \nparamhans, as well as satsangis from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n24.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said to the paramhans, “I shall explain how \nsthiti can be attained by gnãn.  What is this gnãn like?  Well, it is \ngreater than Prakruti and Purush.  When sthiti is attained by this \ngnãn, Prakruti-Purush and their actions do not come into view.  This \nis known as gnãn-pralay.  A person, who has attained this sthiti, sees \nonly pure chaitanya, within which only the murti of Bhagvãn resides, \nwith no other forms remaining.  At times, a person cannot even see \nthe murti of Bhagvãn within that divine light; only the light is seen.  \nAt other times however, both the divine light and the murti of \nBhagvãn are seen.  This is known as sthiti attained by gnãn.  Such \nsthiti is attained by constantly maintaining the vrutti on the visible \nmurti of Bhagvãn.” \n \n24.3 Continuing, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The extent to which a person has \nunderstood the greatness of Bhagvãn determines the intensity of \nGADHADÃ I \n- 64 - \nboth the divine light experienced in the heart, and the divine sounds \nof prãnav that are heard.  Furthermore, the extent of a person’s \nnishchay and understanding of the greatness of Bhagvãn determines \nthe extent to which vicious thoughts are diminished.  Therefore, \nwhen a person develops absolute nishchay in Bhagvãn and \nthoroughly understands His greatness, all of his vicious thoughts are \neliminated. \n \n24.4 “For example, if a person has sucked a slice of lemon, his teeth \nbecome a little sensitive, but he is still able to chew soft chickpeas.  \nHowever, if he has sucked a whole lemon, he is unable to chew \nchickpeas, and will even have difficulty chewing mung beans.  If he \nhas sucked many lemons, he would be unable to chew cooked rice.  In \nthe same way, when a person has developed ‘sourness’ (nishchay) in \nBhagvãn and an understanding of His greatness, his gums as the four \nantah-karans and the ten indriyas, become sensitised.  In that state, \nwith its gums as the man, the jeev is unable to chew chickpeas \n(thoughts for the vishays).  With its gums as the chitt, the jeev \nbecomes incapable of thinking of the vishays.  With its gums as the \nbuddhi, the jeev becomes incapable of developing a determination for \nthe vishays.  With its gums as the ahankãr, the jeev becomes incapable \nof developing any form of consciousness related to the vishays.  \nSimilarly, the jeev, with its gums as five gnãn-indriyas and five karma-\nindriyas, becomes incapable of chewing chickpeas (vishays). \n \n24.5 “However, the indriyas and the antah-karans of a person who does \nnot have absolute nishchay in Bhagvãn and who has not fully realised \nthe greatness of Bhagvãn, do not withdraw completely from their \nvishays.” \n \n24.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “The svarup of Bhagvãn is greater \nthan Mãyã and its gun, and is free of all types of flaws; but, it is for the \nsake of the kalyãn of jeevs that He appears to be like a human.  In fact, \nBhagvãn does not have any of the flaws that foolish people assign to \nHim.  However, the intellect of the person who describes Bhagvãn \nGADHADÃ I \n- 65 - \nwith such flaws will never be freed of those flaws that he assigns to \nBhagvãn.  Specifically, a person who believes Bhagvãn to be full of \nkãm will himself become intensely full of kãm; a person who believes \nBhagvãn to be full of krodh will himself become intensely full of \nkrodh; a person who believes Bhagvãn to be full of lobh will himself \nbecome intensely full of lobh; and a person who believes Bhagvãn to \nbe full of irshyã will himself become intensively full of irshyã.  In fact, \nwhatever types of flaws a person assigns to Bhagvãn will ultimately \ncause misery to the person himself – just as a fistful of sand thrown at \nthe sun falls back into the eyes of the thrower. \n \n24.7 “On the other hand, if a person understands Bhagvãn to be absolutely \nflawless, then regardless of his own svabhãvs, he himself becomes \nabsolutely flawless as well.” \n \n24.8 Then, Brahmãnand Swãmi asked, “Suppose there is a person whose \nindriyas are not drawn towards any of the vishays, nor do vicious \nthoughts arise in his antah-karans.  He also has absolute nishchay in \nBhagvãn.  Despite this, a feeling of dissatisfaction remains, and he \nfeels hopeless within.  What can be the reason for this?” \n \n24.9 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “That is a major deficiency in the bhakta.  \nDespite the fact that his mind has become stable and that he has firm \nnishchay in Bhagvãn, he still fails to experience intense happiness in \nhis heart.  In particular, he does not feel, ‘I am extremely fortunate \nand completely fulfilled, whereas others in the world are constantly \nbeing troubled by kãm, krodh, lobh, moh, mad, matsar, ãshã, trushnã.  \nThey are subject to the three types of sufferings day and night.  As for \nme, Purushottam Bhagvãn has compassionately revealed His own \nsvarup to me.  He has also freed me from kãm, krodh, and all the other \nvicious natures.  He has also placed me in the company of sãdhus \nsimilar to Nãrad and the Sanakãdik.  Indeed, I am very fortunate’.  \n \n24.10 “Failing to think in this way and failing to remain extremely delighted \nthroughout the day is a major deficiency.  In fact, such a bhakta can \nbe compared to a child who has been given a chintãmani in its hand, \nGADHADÃ I \n- 66 - \nbut derives no happiness from it as the child does not realise the \nchintãmani’s value.  Similarly, the major flaw in that bhakta is that \ndespite having attained Purushottam Bhagvãn, he does not feel \nconstant delight within by realising, ‘I am completely fulfilled’. \n \n24.11 “Moreover, when a fault is noticed in a haribhakta, a person should \nthink, ‘His svabhãv is such that it is not suitable in satsang; \nnevertheless, he has attained satsang.  Regardless of what he is like, he \nhas still remained in satsang.  Then, surely his sanskãrs from past lives \nor from this very life must be extremely favourable for him to have \nattained this satsang’.  With this understanding, he should highly \nappreciate even such a person’s gun.” \n \n24.12 After this talk, Shreeji Mahãrãj bid “Jay Sachidãnand” to everyone and \nreturned to His residence. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 24 || 24 ||",

    "title": "Ãtmã-Nishthã",
    "content": "Ãtmã-Nishthã \nKnowledge Of Bhagvãn Leads To Fulfilment \n \n25.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the morning of Posh sud 7 [23rd \nDecember, 1819], Shreeji Mahãrãj arrived at the residence of the \nparamhans in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a \nwhite khes and had covered Himself with a white chofãl.  He had also \ntied a white feto around His head.  He was sitting facing east on the \nwestern veranda.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n25.2 Out of compassion, Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “A bhakta of Bhagvãn, \nwho follows only svadharma, does not feel completely fulfilled within \nhis heart.  That feeling of fulfilment can only be attained by ãtmã-\nnishthã and the knowledge of Bhagvãn’s greatness.  Moreover, \nabsence of these two qualities, determines the extent of the \nGADHADÃ I \n- 67 - \ndeficiency in this experience of fulfilment.  Therefore, a bhakta of \nBhagvãn should firmly develop these two qualities. \n \n25.3 “The deficiency remaining in these two factors also determines the \nextent of the difficulty experienced during samãdhi.  Recently, I \ngranted samãdhi to a haribhakta in which she saw intense divine \nlight.  Seeing the light, she began to scream, and she shouted, ‘I’m \nburning!’  Therefore, even those who experience samãdhi, require \nknowledge of the ãtmã.  If a person does not realise his own svarup to \nbe the ãtmã, and instead believes his svarup to be the body, the \ndeficiency will remain.   \n \n25.4 “I explained to that bhakta, ‘Your svarup is the ãtmã, not the body.  You \nare not this Lãdkibai of the Bhãt sub-caste; instead, your svarup is the \nãtmã, which is achhedhya and abhedhya’.  I then placed her into \nsamãdhi again and told her, ‘Go to the four-petalled kamal at the site \nof Ganpati, and look at your svarup there’. \n \n25.5 “When a person in samãdhi enters the site of Ganpati, that person \nhears divine sounds and sees divine light.  When he enters the higher \nplace of Brahmã, he hears louder sounds and sees brighter light.  \nWhen he enters the still higher place of Vishnu, he hears even louder \nsounds and sees even brighter light.  In this way, as he enters higher \nand higher locations, he hears increasingly louder sounds and sees \nincreasingly brighter light.  As a result of the intense divine light seen \nin samãdhi, and the loud thunderous sounds that occur, even the \nmost strong-minded become fearful.  \n \n25.6 “For example, despite being a bhakta of Bhagvãn and despite being \nextremely brave, Arjun was incapable of beholding Bhagvãn’s \nVishvarup form.  He therefore pleaded, ‘O Mahãrãj!  I am incapable of \nbeholding this svarup of yours.  Please grant me darshan of your \nformer svarup’.  Similarly, in samãdhi, when thundering noises like \nthose of an entire brahmãnd exploding are heard, and masses of \nGADHADÃ I \n- 68 - \nintense light like overflowing oceans are seen, even the brave lose \ntheir patience.  Therefore, a person should understand his own \nsvarup to be distinct from the body.  \n \n25.7 “Samãdhi experienced in this way is achieved in two ways.  One is by \ncontrolling the prãns through prãnãyam, whereby the chitt is also \ncontrolled.  The other is by controlling the chitt, whereby the prãns \nare also controlled.  When is control over the chitt achieved?  It is \nachieved when a person’s vruttis are detached from everything else \nand focused only on Bhagvãn.  However, these vruttis can be focused \non Bhagvãn only when desires for everything else are overcome and \nonly a singular desire for the svarup of Bhagvãn remains.  Then, those \nvruttis will not be deflected from Bhagvãn’s svarup by any means \nwhatsoever.  For example, if twenty pails of water were drawn from a \nwater-well, and the flow of water from each pail flowed in separate \ndirections, then there would be little force in each flow.  However, if \nthe flows of all twenty pails of water are combined, then the resultant \nflow would become extremely powerful – like that of a river – and \nwould not be able to be diverted by any means whatsoever.  \nSimilarly, when a person’s vruttis have become free of worldly \ndesires, his chitt focuses only on Bhagvãn’s svarup.  \n \n25.8 “Conversely, when a person has desires in his chitt for the pleasures \nof the world, his vrutti is widely dispersed among thousands of \ndifferent types of sounds heard via the ear; the vrutti of the skin is \ndispersed among thousands of different types of touch sensations \nthat are felt; the vrutti of the eyes is dispersed among thousands of \ndifferent types of things that are seen; the vrutti of the tongue is \ndispersed among thousands of different types of tastes; the vrutti of \nthe nose is dispersed among countless types of smells.  In the same \nway, the vruttis of his karma-indriyas are dispersed among their \nrespective vishays in thousands of different ways.  In this way, via the \nten indriyas, his antah-karans are dispersed in thousands of different \nways.  Only when his chitt thinks about Bhagvãn, and his man \nGADHADÃ I \n- 69 - \ngenerates thoughts of Bhagvãn, and his buddhi establishes the \nnishchay in the svarup of Bhagvãn, and his ahankãr thinks ‘I am the \nãtmã, and a bhakta of Bhagvãn’, can his desire for Bhagvãn be known \nto have become singular. \n \n25.9 “Alternatively, the control of the chitt by controlling the prãns is \nachieved by ashtãng-yog, which comprises of eight stages:  yam, \nniyam, ãsan, prãnãyam, pratyãhãr, dhãran, dhyãn, and samãdhi.  This \nashtãng-yog is the method, and its gift is the nirvikalp samãdhi of \nBhagvãn.  When this nirvikalp samãdhi is achieved, the chitt is \ncontrolled by controlling the prãns.  On the other hand, if the chitt \nfocuses on Bhagvãn after becoming free of worldly desires, then the \nprãns are controlled by control of the chitt. \n \n25.10 “Therefore, just as the chitt is controlled by mastering ashtãng-yog, \nsimilarly, the chitt can also be controlled by focusing on the svarup of \nBhagvãn.  A bhakta whose chitt’s vrutti becomes focused on the \nsvarup of Bhagvãn, masters ashtãng–yog without even attempting to \nmaster it.  Therefore, the spiritual activities of ãtmã–nishthã and the \nknowledge of Bhagvãn’s greatness that I have just described should \nbe firmly practiced. \n \n25.11 “Furthermore, a person’s vartmãn dharma – which are Bhagvãn’s \nãgnã – should certainly be followed.  For example, the dharma of a \nbrãhman is to bathe, lead a pure life, and never drink even water \nfrom a shudra’s house.  Similarly, a satsangi should never falter in \nfollowing Bhagvãn’s ãgnã.  This is because Bhagvãn will be pleased \nwith him if he behaves accordingly. \n \n25.12 “Moreover, a person should very firmly maintain both the knowledge \nof Bhagvãn’s greatness as well as the knowledge of the ãtmã coupled \nwith vairãgya.  He should also feel fulfilled by realising, ‘Now I have \nno deficiencies remaining’.  With this understanding, he should \nconstantly offer bhakti to Bhagvãn.  Having said this, he should not \nget carried away in the joy of this understanding, and nor should he \nfeel unfulfilled.  If he does feel unfulfilled, then the blessings that have \nGADHADÃ I \n- 70 - \nbeen showered upon him by Bhagvãn can be considered as not \nhaving germinated – like a seed sown in saline soil.  Conversely, if he \ngets carried away and begins to behave disobediently, then that is \nlike having thrown a seed into a fire, which burns it.  Therefore, if a \nperson understands as I have explained, then no form of deficiency \nwill remain.” \n \n25.13 After saying this, Shreeji Mahãrãj returned to His seat.  \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 25 || 25 ||",

    "content": "A True Rasik Bhakta \nThe Nirgun State \n \n26.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the afternoon of Posh sud 11 [27th \nDecember, 1819], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He had tied a white pãgh around His \nhead.  He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a \nwhite chofãl.  Two large guldãvadi flowers had been placed upon His \nears, and a tassel of flowers had been inserted in His pãgh.  A sabhã of \nparamhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him.  Some of the paramhans were singing kirtans to the \naccompaniment of a pakhvãj. \n \n26.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Please stop singing, and listen as I sing a \nkirtan in the form of talks.” \n \n26.3 The paramhans said, “Very well, Mahãrãj.  Please do.” \n \n26.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “If a person is attracted only by Bhagvãn’s \nsvarup while singing rasik kirtans, then that is fine.  But, being \nattracted to anything other than Bhagvãn’s svarup signifies a major \nGADHADÃ I \n- 71 - \ndeficiency.  This is because just as that bhakta develops affection for \nand is attracted by sounds related to Bhagvãn, he also develops \naffection for and is attracted by worldly songs, musical instruments, \nand talks related to women.  Such a bhakta should be known to lack \nwisdom.  Therefore, a person who is attracted equally by the words \nof Bhagvãn and His sant, and by worldly speech, should abandon \nsuch foolishness.  Having abandoned such foolishness, he should \nexperience happiness through sounds and speech related only to \nBhagvãn.  Such a person is a true rasik bhakta. \n \n26.5 “Furthermore, just as that rasik bhakta wishes for sounds related \nonly to Bhagvãn, he desires only the touch of Bhagvãn.  When he \nrealises that other types of touch are like touching a black cobra or a \nblazing fire, he is a true rasik bhakta.  Similarly, if a person \nexperiences extreme bliss on seeing Bhagvãn, and realises everything \nelse to be like a pile of filth or a dead dog, then he is true rasik bhakta.  \nSimilarly, if a person experiences extreme bliss after tasting the \nprasãd of Bhagvãn, and not from enjoying other various types of \ntastes, then he is a true rasik bhakta. \n \n26.6 “Furthermore, such a bhakta experiences profound bliss on smelling \ntulsi, garlands of flowers, and many varieties of small fragrant items \nlike perfume and sandalwood that have been offered to Bhagvãn.  He \nis not pleased on smelling the perfume, sandalwood, or garlands of \nflowers worn by people.  In this way, a person who has intense love \nfor panch-vishays related to Bhagvãn and an intense dislike for \nworldly panch-vishays is a true rasik bhakta.   \n \n26.7 “On the other hand, a person who becomes a rasik bhakta, but still \nderives the same pleasure from other types of shabda, sparsh, rup, \nras, and gandh as he does from Bhagvãn–related vishays, is a false \nrasik bhakta.  This is because he experiences the same type of joy \nfrom vishays as he does from Bhagvãn.  Therefore, such affection and \nmode of worship should be abandoned.  This is because it is not \nGADHADÃ I \n- 72 - \nBhagvãn who is at fault – it is the rasik bhakta’s attitude that is at \nfault, as he has believed Bhagvãn to be exactly like other objects.  As a \nresult, his bhakti and affection are flawed. \n \n26.8 “Now, just as I have described caution in indulging in the five types of \nvishays for the sthul body in the jãgrat state, similarly, subtle vishays \nexist for the sukshma body in the svapna state.  A bhakta may \nexperience happiness from shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh \nrelated to Bhagvãn on seeing the svarup of Bhagvãn in his dream, but \nif he also derives exactly the same pleasure on seeing other vishays in \nhis dream, then that bhakta’s affection is false.  On the other hand, if a \nperson in his dream experiences happiness only by association with \nBhagvãn and feels a dislike for other vishays as if they were vomited \nfood, then he can be said to be a true rasik bhakta.  However, if he \ndoes not have a dislike for the other vishays, then although the svarup \nof Bhagvãn seen in his dream is true, that bhakta’s understanding is \nflawed.  This is because he has equal love for Bhagvãn and for other \nvishays.  Therefore, true understanding is to remain attracted only \ntowards the svarup of Bhagvãn, and not towards other vishays.  \n  \n26.9 “In this way, when only thoughts of Bhagvãn remain while thinking, \nthe mind becomes completely void, with the exception of the murti of \nBhagvãn, and that bhakta does not identify the body or the brahmãnd \nat all.  Then, while seeing the murti of Bhagvãn within that void, \ndivine light is generated, and the murti of Bhagvãn is seen within that \nlight.  So, love towards only the svarup of Bhagvãn in this way, is \ncalled pati-vratã bhakti.” \n \n26.10 In conclusion, Shreeji Mahãrãj added, “When you sing rasik kirtans, I \nalso close my eyes and think about just this.  These thoughts of mine \nmay be simple, but nothing is able to persist in those thoughts except \nBhagvãn.  In fact, my thoughts are so powerful that if any vishay were \nto come in the way of the rasik love that I have for Bhagvãn’s svarup, \nits head would be cut off.  Just as you prepare a kirtan to sing, I \nGADHADÃ I \n- 73 - \nprepared this kirtan in the form of a talk, which I have shared with \nyou all today.” \n \n26.11 In this way, using Himself as an example, Shreeji Mahãrãj delivered \nthese talks for the benefit of His bhaktas. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 26 || 26 ||",

    "content": "The Power Of Bhagvãn \nBhagvãn Resides In The Heart Of A Sant \n \n27.1 In the Samvat year 1876, before sunrise on Posh sud 12 [28th \nDecember, 1819], Shreeji Mahãrãj arrived at the residential hall of \nthe paramhans in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  There, He sat \non a platform facing west.  He had tied a white feto around His head, \nand he was wearing a khes.  He had also covered Himself with a white \nchofãl.  A sabhã of paramhans had gathered before Him. \n \n27.2 After a few minutes of deep thought, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Everyone \nwishes to worship Bhagvãn, but their understanding differs.  \nBhagvãn fully resides in the heart of a person who possesses the \nfollowing understanding: ‘The earth remains stable and trembles; the \nstars remain steady in the sky; the rains fall; the sun rises and sets; the \nmoon appears and disappears, and it waxes and wanes; the vast oceans \nremain constrained within their boundaries; a drop of liquid develops \ninto a human possessing hands, feet, a nose, ears, and the rest of the ten \nindriyas; the clouds, through which lightning strikes, float unsupported \nin the sky – these and a countless variety of the other wonders are only \ndue to the Bhagvãn that I have attained’. With this understanding, he \nhas the belief that no one except the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvãn is \nthe cause of these wonders.  He realises, ‘The countless wonders which \nhave occurred in the past, those which are currently taking place, and \nGADHADÃ I \n- 74 - \nthose which will occur in the future, are all only due to the pratyaksha \nsvarup of Bhagvãn that I have attained’. \n \n27.3 “Moreover, he also understands that ‘Even if someone were to throw \ndust on me, or were to humiliate me in any way, or were to seat me on \na donkey after cutting off my nose and ears, or even if someone were to \nhonour me by seating me on an elephant – all these situations would be \nequal for me’.  Such a bhakta views a beautiful young woman with \nequality, he treats a heap of gold and a pile of stones with equality, \nand he also possesses countless glorious qualities, such as gnãn, \nbhakti, and vairãgya.  Bhagvãn eternally resides in the heart of such a \nbhakta. \n \n27.4 “Consequently, by the grace of Bhagvãn, that bhakta attains countless \ntypes of power, and gives kalyãn to countless beings.  Despite these \npowers, he tolerates the praises and insults of other people.  This \nitself is also a great achievement, because to tolerate insults, despite \nbeing so powerful, is not easy for others to achieve.  Therefore, a \nperson who tolerates in this way should be considered to be \nextremely great. \n \n27.5 “The powers of such a person are such that Bhagvãn sees through his \neyes, which empowers the eyes of all the beings in the brahmãnd; \nand since it is Bhagvãn who walks through his legs, he is also capable \nof giving the strength to walk to the legs of all the beings in the \nbrahmãnd.  Therefore, since it is Bhagvãn who resides in all the \nindriyas of such a sant, that sant us able to give power to the indriyas \nof all the life-forms in the brahmãnd.  Therefore, such a sant sustains \nthe world.  His greatness lies in the fact that he tolerates the insults \ndelivered even by insignificant people.  Only those who are forgiving \nin this way should be considered to be extremely great. \n \n27.6 “On the other hand, those who threaten and frighten those who are \nmore humble than themselves, and believe ‘I have become great’, are \nnot truly great.  In fact, those people in this world who frighten \nothers by showing extraordinary powers, should not be considered \nGADHADÃ I \n- 75 - \nto be bhaktas of Bhagvãn.  Instead, they are jeevs lost in mãyã, and \nare only suitable for Yampuri.  Their greatness is limited to the \nworldly life.  For example, in society, a person with one horse is \nconsidered to be greater than someone with no horses at all, whereas \na person with five horses is considered to be greater than someone \nwith only one horse.  In this way, the wealthier a person is, the \ngreater he is considered to be in society.  However, such a person is \nnot great in worshipping Bhagvãn.” \n \n27.7 Continuing, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A grahastha or sãdhu who \nbelieves, ‘This woman is very beautiful; these clothes are extremely \nfashionable; this medi is very nice; and this utensil is very lovely’, has \nlittle knowledge.  Then, you may ask, ‘Will such people attain kalyãn \nor not?’  Well, in this satsang, even the wretched attain kalyãn.  \nHowever, the people described never develop the qualities of a \nsãdhu, or the glorious qualities of the sant previously described.  This \nis because they have not become suitable for such nobility.” \n \n27.8 After delivering these talks, Shreeji Mahãrãj bid “Jay Sachidãnand” to \nall, and returned to His residence in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 27 || 27 ||",

    "content": "The Nature Of A Person Who Will Fall From Satsang \n \n28.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Posh sud 14 [30th December, 1819], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda \noutside the room in line with the room of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan, in \nDãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  At that time, the sãdhus had sat down to eat in His presence. \n \n28.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “When a satsangi is likely to fall from \nsatsang, vicious desires steadily flourish within him.  At first, he \nGADHADÃ I \n- 76 - \nbegins to perceive avgun in all satsangis day by day.  In his heart, he \nfeels, ‘All of these satsangis lack understanding; only I have true \nunderstanding’.  In this way, he considers himself to be superior to all.  \nSuch a person remains constantly uneasy, day and night.  He cannot \nsit peacefully anywhere during the day; nor can he sleep at night.  \nMoreover, his anger never subsides.  In fact, he constantly smoulders \nlike a half-burnt log.  A person who behaves in this way should be \nknown to be on the verge of falling out of satsang.  No matter how \nmany days he spends in satsang, he will never experience peace in \nhis heart.  Therefore, he will fall from satsang. \n \n28.3 “Conversely, when a person is likely to advance in satsang, pure \ndesires steadily flourish within him.  Day by day, he perceives only \ngun in all satsangis; he views all bhaktas as superior to himself and \nconsiders himself to be insignificant.  Moreover, he experiences the \nbliss of satsang in his heart twenty-four hours a day.  Such \ncharacteristics indicate that pure desires have flourished.  In fact, the \nmore such a person practices satsang, the more he benefits.  \nEventually, he attains extreme greatness.” \n \n28.4 Having delivered this talk, Shreeji Mahãrãj bid “Jay Sachidãnand” to \nall and returned to His seat. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 28 || 28 ||",

He was wearing a white khes and had \ncovered Himself with a white chofãl.  He had also tied a white pãgh \nGADHADÃ I \n- 77 - \naround His head.  He was wearing garlands of white flowers, and a \ntassel of white flowers was hanging from His pãgh.  A sabhã of \nsãdhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n29.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Please ask a question.” \n \n29.3 Then, Gopãlãnand Swãmi asked, “How can the force of bhakti coupled \nwith dharma, gnãn, and vairãgya be intensified?” \n \n29.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “There are four means to accomplish this: \nThe first is a pure desh, the second is a pleasant kãl, the third is \nspiritual kriyã, and the fourth is the sang of a sat-purush.  Of these, the \ninfluence of desh, kãl, and sang are more powerful than kriyã.  This is \nbecause, if a desh is pure, and kãl is pure, and a person also keeps the \nsang of sant like yourself, then kriyã will naturally be pure as well.  \nConversely, if a desh is impure – like the region of Sindh, if the kãl is \nimpure, and if a person also keeps the sang of prostitutes and \nperverted people, or of those who consume alcohol and meat, then \nkriyã will certainly be impure as well.  Therefore, a person should \nstay where there is a pure desh, and should abandon a place where \nthe kãl has become unpleasant.  A person should keep the sang of a \nbhakta of Bhagvãn, as well as the sang of a sant who abides by the \npanch-vartmãn.  As a result, a haribhakta’s bhakti for Bhagvãn gains \ntremendous energy.  This is the answer to your question.” \n \n29.5 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, initially a haribhakta may \nbe very impure at heart, but he later becomes extremely pure.  Is this \ndue to his previous sanskãrs, the grace of Bhagvãn, or the bhakta’s \npersonal efforts?” \n \n29.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The good or bad that occurs due to \nperson’s previous sanskãrs is apparent to everyone in the world.  For \ninstance, the cause of Bharatji becoming attached to a deer can be \nGADHADÃ I \n- 78 - \nunderstood to be due to prãrabdha.  Or, if a poor person were to \nreceive a large kingdom, then everyone would come to know of it.  \nThat should be known as prãrabdha.” \n \n29.7 Then, narrating His own story, Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, \n“Considering the spiritual activities I have performed, it is \nunimaginable that my body has survived such strictness, yet even in \nthose circumstances it did survive.  That can be considered to be due \nto prãrabdha.  What were those circumstances?  Well, while staying \nin Purushottam-Puri, I spent many months surviving merely on air.  \nOn one occasion, I allowed my body to be carried away by a river that \nwas four to five miles wide.  During the winter, summer, and \nmonsoon, I stayed without shelter, wearing only a loincloth.  I also \nused to wander in the jungle amongst wild animals such as tigers, \nelephants, and wildebeests.  I travelled in many frightful conditions, \nyet my body did not perish.  In these situations, a person should \nconsider prãrabdha to be responsible.   \n \n29.8 “Now, consider the son of the brãhman named Sãndipani whose son \nwas saved from Narak, and when five-year-old Dhruvji prayed to \nBhagvãn, the meanings of the Veds and other shãstras were \nspontaneously revealed to him.  In these situations – as well as when \na person’s mind is purified by the wish of Bhagvãn or by His grace, or \nby the grace of His ekãntik sãdhu who has been pleased by a person’s \nextremely pure sentiments – the influence of Bhagvãn’s grace should \nbe considered to be responsible. \n29.9 “If a person keeps the sang of a devout sãdhu and becomes virtuous \nthrough his own thoughts, then that is known as purush-prayatna.” \n \n29.10 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj bid “Jay Sachidãnand” to the sabhã \nand returned to His seat laughing. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 29 || 29 || \n \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 79 -",

    "content": "The Influence Of The Gun Of Mãyã \n \n30.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Posh vad 1 [1st January, \n1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the \nveranda outside the room facing north, in line with the mandir of \nShree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan, in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white \nchãdar.  He had also tied a white feto around His head, with tassels of \nwhite flowers hanging from it.  He was wearing a garland of white \nflowers, bunches of white flowers were placed above His ears.  He \nwas also wearing berkhã of white flowers around His wrists.  A sabhã \nof munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him.  Some of the munis were singing kirtans. \n \n30.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then requested, “Please begin a question-answer \ndiscussion.” \n \n30.3 Dinã-Nãth Bhatt then asked, “At times, thousands of thoughts arise, \nyet they do not leave a lasting impression in the mind.  At other \ntimes, only an irrelevant thought arises, yet it leaves a strong \nimpression in the mind.  What is the reason for this?  Also, by what \nmeans can a bhakta eliminate such disturbing thoughts?” \n \n30.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “The reason is the influence of the gun.  \nThoughts occurring when tamo-gun is predominant, induce a state \nsimilar to that of sushupti.  Therefore, those thoughts do not leave a \nlasting impression in the mind.  When sattva-gun prevails, a person \nexperiences a state of awareness.  Therefore, any disturbing thoughts \nthat occur at that time, are dispelled by thinking.  Therefore, those \nthoughts do not leave a lasting impression either.  However, thoughts \nthat arise when rajo-gun is prevalent, leave a lasting impression in \nthe mind.  Therefore, the reason some thoughts do leave a lasting \nimpression in the mind and others do not, is due to the prevalence of \nthe different gun. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 80 - \n30.5 “If an intelligent person reflects on this matter and examines his \nthoughts whenever they arise, he will be able to recognise which gun \nis predominant in him at that particular time.  However, subtle \nthoughts that arise repeatedly from moment to moment cannot be \ngrasped by anyone.  At the most, someone intelligent like yourself \nmay be able to distinguish two, three, or four of the more superficial \nthoughts that arise during the course of a day. \n \n30.6 “So, if a person examines the predominant gun under whose \ninfluence his thoughts arise, and thinks about the spiritual talks \nwhich takes place in satsang, then the power of satsang is such that \nany disturbing thoughts, which arise under the influence of the gun, \nare dispelled.  Then, becoming free from all doubts, he is able to \ncontinuously concentrate on the svarup of Bhagvãn.  \n \n30.7 “Without satsang, even if a person carries out millions of spiritual \nactivities, disturbing thoughts and the influence of rajo-gun and the \nother gun will not be eradicated.  Therefore, if someone sincerely \npractices satsang and reflects upon the talks relating to Bhagvãn, \nthen his vile thoughts will be eradicated.  In this way, the influence of \nsatsang is extremely powerful.  In fact, no other spiritual activity can \ncompare with satsang.  Therefore, a person who wishes to rid the \nmind of thoughts related to rajo-gun, should sincerely practice \nsatsang by thought, word, and deed.  As a result, disturbing thoughts \nwill be eradicated due to the power of satsang.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 30 || 30 ||",

    "content": "The Person With Bhakti Is Best \n \n31.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Posh vad 2 [2nd January, \n1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a large, \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on the east-facing veranda \nGADHADÃ I \n- 81 - \noutside His residence in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was \ndressed entirely in white clothes. \n \n31.2 At that time, Yogãnand Muni asked, “Mahãrãj, suppose there are two \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn.  One bhakta follows nivrutti and does not hurt \nanyone verbally.  The other, is constantly serving Bhagvãn and His \nbhaktas, by offering food, clothes, and flowers.  However, in doing so, \nhe may occasionally hurt someone verbally.  Of these two bhaktas, \nwho is better?” \n \n31.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj did not answer the question.  Instead, He called for \nMuktãnand Swãmi and Brahmãnand Swãmi.  He had them listen to \nthe question, and then requested, “Please answer this question.” \n \n31.4 Both Muktãnand Swãmi and Brahmãnand Swãmi then answered.  \n“The bhakta who may verbally hurt someone, but serves Bhagvãn \nand His sant, is better.  The bhakta who follows nivrutti and does not \nhurt anyone, and is therefore unable to serve Bhagvãn and His sant, \nshould therefore be known to be feeble.  The bhakta who serves \nothers can be described as having bhakti.  Therefore, the bhakta with \nbhakti is the better of the two.” \n \n31.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj confirmed, “The answer you have given is correct.”  \nHe then added, “It is a major weakness if a person notices a small \navgun in someone who possesses this bhakti and completely abides \nby Bhagvãn’s ãgnã, and then develops hatred for him.  A person who \nperceives avgun in this way may also perceive avgun in Bhagvãn, \nwho has assumed a human form for the purpose of granting kalyãn to \nthe jeevs.  He may also perceive avgun in the profoundly great \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn. \n \n31.6 “Moreover, just because such a person alleges such faults in Bhagvãn \nor His sant, does that mean the avatãrs of Bhagvãn or sant are \nincapable of granting kalyãn?  They are indeed capable of granting \nGADHADÃ I \n- 82 - \nkalyãn.  However, a person whose intellect is distorted, always \nnegatively misinterprets things.  For example, Shishupãl always said, \n‘The Pãndavs are from a different cast.  They are immoral because all \nfive of them have the same wife.  Krishna is also a scoundrel, because \nfrom the moment He was born, He first killed a woman, then He killed a \ncrane, and then He killed a calf.  He is known as Madhusudan not \nbecause He killed a demon named Madhu, but because he destroyed \nhoneycombs.  Just because those Pãndavs worship Him, does that make \nHim Bhagvãn?’  In this way, Shishupãl, with his demonic intellect, \nidentified avgun in Bhagvãn and His bhaktas.  However, the bhaktas \nof Bhagvãn did not do so in any way.  Therefore, a person who \nperceives avgun should be known to have a demonic intellect.” \n \n31.7 Hearing this, Yogãnand Muni said, “Mahãrãj, we do not perceive \navgun in the great bhaktas of Bhagvãn, but we do perceive avgun in \nordinary bhaktas.” \n \n31.8 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A bhakta’s greatness or smallness is not \nmeasured the way you seem to understand it.  Greatness is due to a \nperson’s nishchay in the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvãn and by \nfollowing His ãgnãs.  However great a person may be in worldly \nmatters, if he lacks these two characteristics, then he is still ordinary. \n \n31.9 “The greatness which I have just described is present today in all the \nbhaktas in our satsang.  This is because all the bhaktas here realise, \n‘We have found pratyaksha Purushottam Bhagvãn, who is greater than \neven Akshar.  Therefore, we are completely happy’.  Realising this, they \noffer bhakti to pratyaksha Bhagvãn, while following His ãgnãs.  \nTherefore, on seeing some irrelevant personal abnormality in such a \nbhakta, a person should not perceive avgun in him.  If a person does \nhave a habit of doing so, then his intellect becomes demonic.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 31 || 31 || \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 83 -",

    "content": "A Bhakta Always Rests In The Murti Of Bhagvãn \n \n32.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the morning of Posh vad 3 [3rd January, \n1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the \nveranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes and had tied a white pãgh \naround his head.  He had also covered Himself with a white chãdar, \nand His forehead had been smeared with sandalwood paste.  He was \nwearing a garland of white flowers, and a tassel of white flowers was \nhanging from His pãgh. A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him.  Some of the munis were \nsinging kirtans. \n \n32.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Please listen, I have a question to ask.” \n \n32.3 The munis and haribhaktas replied, “Mahãrãj, please ask.” \n \n32.4 After thinking for quite some time, Shree Mahãrãj said, “In this world, \na materialistic individual who is attached to the five vishays, cannot \nsurvive without indulging in them.  Moreover, just as that vimukh \nindulges in the five vishays, a bhakta of Bhagvãn also indulges in five \nvishays.  So, how are the two different? In what way?  Well, the \nmaterialistic person enjoys worldly vishays without Bhagvãn.  \nHowever, for a bhakta of Bhagvãn, listening to kathãs of Bhagvãn is \nthe only vishay for his ears; touching the charanãvind of Bhagvãn or \ntouching the holy dust from the holy feet of a sant is the only vishay \nfor his skin; having darshan of Bhagvãn or His sant is the only vishay \nfor his eyes; taking the prasãd of Bhagvãn and singing His praises are \nthe only vishays for his tongue; and scents of flowers and other \nobjects which have been offered to Bhagvãn is the only vishay for his \nnose.  In this way, there is a difference between the vishays that a \nvimukh indulges in and those that a bhakta indulges in. \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 84 - \n32.5 “Furthermore, just as a bhakta cannot stay without indulging in the \nvishays, even eternally liberated muktas, such as Nãrad and the \nSanakãdik, cannot stay without indulging in them.  Although they \nremain in samãdhi for long periods of time, after emerging from \nsamãdhi, they also indulge in vishays in the form kathãs, kirtans, and \ntalks of Bhagvãn. \n \n32.6 “For example, birds leave their nests to gather food, but after \ngathering their food, they always return to their nests at night to rest.  \nThey never forget their own nests and return to another bird’s nest.  \nSimilarly, after feeding on kathãs, kirtans, and talks of Bhagvãn, \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn also return to their own nest (Bhagvãn’s svarup) \nto rest.  Also, animals, birds, and in fact, all creatures, return to their \nown homes to rest after feeding.  People also travel far and wide for \ntheir work, but only when they return to their own home do they rest \npeacefully. \n \n32.7 “Now, based on the analogies that I have just narrated, I ask all the \nharibhaktas a question: Just as a vimukh is attached to the five vishays \nand is unable to live without them for even a single moment, have \nyou becoming firmly attached to the vishays in the form of the kathãs, \nkirtans, and talks of Bhagvãn, or not?  I also ask another question: \nJust as a bird returns to its nest after feeding, do all of you also return \nto rest in your nest (Bhagvãn), after feeding on kathãs, kirtans, and \ntalks of Bhagvãn?  Or, do you rest elsewhere? \n \n32.8 “Additionally, domesticated cattle return to their post in the evening \nafter grazing on the outskirts of the village, whereas stray cattle do \nnot return to their post.  A stray cow, after grazing in someone’s field, \nsits wherever it wishes.  There, someone may beat it, or it may even \nbe attacked by a tiger.  Now, do you return to your post like the \ndomesticated cattle, or do you sit down to rest anywhere after \ngrazing in someone else’s field like the stray cattle?  Those who are \nsenior amongst you, think about your answer to these questions.” \nGADHADÃ I \n- 85 - \n32.9 Then, all the munis and bhaktas replied individually, “Mahãrãj, we \nhave indeed become attached to kathãs, kirtans, and talks related to \nBhagvãn.  Except for the nest and post (Bhagvãn’s murti), we do not \nstay anywhere else.”  Hearing their reply, Shreeji Mahãrãj became \nextremely pleased. \n \n32.10 On that same day, towards the end of the afternoon, Shreeji Mahãrãj \nwas seated on a large decorated bedstead under the neem tree in the \ncentre of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr, facing the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-\nNãrãyan.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him.  Some of the munis were singing \nkirtans. \n \n32.11 Shreeji Mahãrãj then requested, “Now, please begin a question-\nanswer discussion.” \n \n32.12 Dinã-Nãth Bhatt and Brahmãnand Swãmi asked, “At times, a bhakta \nof Bhagvãn is able to blissfully engage in bhajan and smaran of \nBhagvãn, and is able to concentrate on His murti.  At other times, he \nis disturbed within and is unable to experience the bliss of bhajan \nand smaran.  What is the reason for this?” \n \n32.13 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “He has not learned the technique of \nvisualising the murti of Bhagvãn.” \n \n32.14 Hearing this, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “What is that technique?” \n \n32.15 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The technique is as follows: Different gun \nenter the antah-karans at different times.  When sattva-gun prevails, \nthe antah-karans are pure, and a person can pleasantly engage in \nbhajan and smaran of Bhagvãn’s murti.  When rajo-gun prevails, the \nantah-karans become polluted and many disturbing thoughts arise, \nmaking it difficult to engage in bhajan and smaran.  When tamo-gun \nprevails, no thoughts arise in the antah-karans at all.  Therefore, a \nGADHADÃ I \n- 86 - \nperson engaged in bhajan should learn to recognise the prevailing \ngun and should perform dhyãn upon the murti of Bhagvãn whenever \nsattva-gun prevails.  When tamo-gun prevails, no thoughts arise at all, \nand a person experiences a feeling of emptiness.  A person should not \nattempt to perform dhyãn upon Bhagvãn in such conditions.  When \nrajo-gun prevails, many disturbing thoughts arise.  Therefore, a \nperson should not attempt to perform dhyãn upon Bhagvãn at that \ntime either.  On such occasions, a person should think, ‘I am distinct \nfrom these thoughts, and I am an ãtmã.  In fact, I am the knower of \nthese thoughts.  Furthermore, Purushottam Bhagvãn is forever present \nwithin me as antaryãmi’.  Only when the force of rajo-gun decreases \nshould a person perform dhyãn upon the murti of Bhagvãn. \n \n32.16 “However, a person should not become unhappy on noticing the \nmany thoughts which arise when rajo-gun prevails.  After all, the \nantah-karans are like a small child, or a monkey, or a dog, or like a \nperson who plays with a child.  The nature of the antah-karans are \nsuch that it remains restless for no reason whatsoever.  Therefore, a \nperson who wishes to perform dhyãn upon Bhagvãn should not \nbecome disheartened on seeing the disturbing thoughts that arise in \nthe antah-karans.  Moreover, the thoughts arising in the antah-karans \nshould be regarded as being distinct from himself.  Therefore, a \nperson should engage in the bhajan of Bhagvãn, while believing the \nãtmã to be distinct from himself.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 32 || 32 ||",

    "content": "Blind Faith, Love, And Understanding \n \n33.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Posh vad 5 [5th January, \n1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting facing east on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the room next to the mandir of \nShree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white \nGADHADÃ I \n- 87 - \nchãdar.  He had also tied a reto, with deep orange ends, around His \nhead.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n33.2 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “The shãstras have described \ncountless spiritual activities that please Bhagvãn.  Amongst them all, \nwhich one is so powerful that it alone earns as much bliss of Bhagvãn, \nas is earned by performing all spiritual activities combined?  Please \nreveal it to us.” \n \n33.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Please listen as I tell you the one spiritual \nactivity by which Bhagvãn can be pleased.”  He then continued, \n“Accepting the firm refuge of Bhagvãn is the single, greatest activity \namongst all spiritual activities for pleasing Bhagvãn.  However, that \nrefuge must be extremely firm and without any flaws. \n \n33.4 “There are three types of refuge.  One way of having the refuge of \nBhagvãn is with blind faith.  If a person has intense blind faith, then \neven if someone such as Brahmã were to attempt to deflect him from \nhis refuge, he would not be deflected. \n \n33.5 “The second type is firm refuge of Bhagvãn that is created out of love.  \nWhoever has intense love for Bhagvãn, cannot even forcibly be \nattracted to any object other than Bhagvãn.  This is known as firm \nrefuge produced out of intense love. \n \n33.6 “The third type is refuge with understanding.  A person who has \ngreat intelligence understands the sagun-nirgun and anvay-vyatirek \naspects of Bhagvãn.  He understands entities that have been created \nby Bhagvãn’s Mãyã, as well as the ways Bhagvãn takes avatãrs on \nearth.  He also understands how, at the time of creation of the \nuniverse, Bhagvãn behaves as Akshar, how Bhagvãn behaves as \nPrakruti-Purush, how Bhagvãn behaves as Virãt-Purush, how \nBhagvãn behaves as Brahmã and other prajãpatis.  He also \nunderstands how Bhagvãn works through those like Nãrad and the \nGADHADÃ I \n- 88 - \nSanakãdik, for the purpose of granting kalyãn to the jeevs.  He \nunderstands all these methods. \n \n33.7 “Moreover, he realises that Purushottam Bhagvãn is greater than \neverything and is absolutely unaffected.  He who has such an \nunderstanding is said to have a firm refuge of Bhagvãn using his \nintelligence.  If someone tries to discourage him, or even if he tries to \ndiscourage himself, such refuge never fades away.  Also, regardless of \nwhether Bhagvãn – assuming a human svarup – displays His divine \npower or acts powerless, such a person’s intellect would not hold any \ndoubts.”  \n \n33.8 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “If you allow me, I wish to ask a question.” \n \n33.9 Muktãnand Swãmi replied, “Mahãrãj, please do ask.” \n \n33.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj then asked, “Of the three characteristics I have just \ndescribed to you, which is your strength?  Although a combination of \nall three is found in all bhaktas of Bhagvãn, the characteristic that is \nstrongest, is said to be the strength they posses.  So, of the three – \nblind faith, love, and understanding – which is your strength?” \n \n33.11 Muktãnand Swãmi and Brahmãnand Swãmi both replied, “Our \ncharacteristic is of understanding.” \n \n33.12 Then, the other sãdhus also stated their own strengths. \n \n||End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 33 || 33 ||",

    "content": "Love Is The Mãyã Of Bhagvãn \nDo Not Disobey The Ãgnã Of Bhagvãn \n \n34.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the morning of Posh vad 11 [11th \nJanuary, 1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting facing south on a \ndecorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of \nGADHADÃ I \n- 89 - \nDãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes and \nhad covered Himself with a white chofãl.  He had also tied a white \npãgh around His head, and was wearing garlands of flowers.  Tassels \nof flowers and silken threads were hanging from His pãgh, and \nbunches of flowers had been placed above both of His ears.  A sabhã \nof munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him.  Some of the munis were singing kirtans to the \naccompaniment of musical instruments. \n \n34.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please stop the kirtans, and begin a \nquestion-answer discussion.” \n \n34.3 Then, Brahmãnand Swãmi asked, “Bhagvãn is the cause of all bliss, \nand He is greater than everything, yet the jeev’s vrutti does not \nbecome attached to Him.  Instead, its vrutti becomes attached to \nworldly objects that are worthless and perishable.  What is the \nreason for this?” \n \n34.4 Muktãnand Swãmi attempted to give an answer, but was unable to do \nso adequately.   \n \n34.5 So Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please listen as I answer that question.  \nSince the day Bhagvãn created this world, He has set it in motion in \nsuch a way that he will not have to make an effort again.  In fact, He \nhas devised it in such a way that procreation occurs automatically.  \nMen naturally develop affection for women, women naturally \ndevelop affection for men, and both naturally develop affection for \ntheir children.  That is Bhagvãn’s mãyã in the form of affection. \n \n34.6 “The vrutti of a person who is not swept away by the flow of that \nmãyã, remains focused on the svarup of Bhagvãn.  So, a bhakta of \nBhagvãn develops vairãgya by maintaining a dislike for worldly \nobjects.  Furthermore, knowing Bhagvãn to be absolutely blissful, he \nkeeps his vrutti focused on Bhagvãn.  However, if a person does not \nGADHADÃ I \n- 90 - \ndevelop vairãgya towards worldly objects and becomes distanced \nfrom the svarup of Bhagvãn, then even great muktas, such as Shiv, \nBrahmã, and Nãrad, would be swept away by those worldly objects.  \nFor this reason, if a person abandons Bhagvãn and keeps the \ncompany of worldly objects, then his vrutti will most certainly \nbecome attached to those worldly objects.  Therefore, a bhakta of \nBhagvãn should not keep affection for anything other than Bhagvãn.” \n \n34.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Now, it is Muktãnand Swãmi’s turn to ask \na question, so please ask.” \n \n34.8 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “It is extremely difficult for a person \nto attain Bhagvãn.  Moreover, there is no greater benefit and no \ngreater bliss than attaining Bhagvãn.  Then, why do people abandon \nsuch immense bliss and struggle painfully for worthless objects?  \nThat is the question.” \n \n34.9 Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Here, I shall answer that.  A person suffers \nwhen he ignores the ãgnã of Bhagvãn and beings to stray away from \nthem.  On the other hand, if he acts according to those ãgnã, he will \nexperience the true bliss of Bhagvãn.  So, a person suffers only to the \nextent that he disobeys the ãgnã of Bhagvãn.  Therefore, tyãgis \nshould live according to the ãgnã that have been prescribed for tyãgi, \nand grahasthas should live according to the ãgnã that have been \nprescribed for grahasthas. \n \n34.10 “A person suffers to the extent that he lapses in following these ãgnã.  \nOnly when a tyãgi follows the eight types of tyãg of women, is his \nvow of brahm-chãrya considered complete.  He suffers to the extent \nthat he deviates from this.  Brahm-chãrya has also been prescribed \nfor grahasthas.  For them, brahm-chãrya constitutes shunning all \nwomen except their wives, abstinence from sexual relations with his \nwife on days of religious occasions, and engaging in sexual relations \nonly during appropriate times.  Whoever deviates from these and \nother niyams that have been prescribed for tyãgis and grahasthas, \nwill suffer accordingly. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 91 - \n34.11 “Therefore, the happiness and misery experienced by a vimukh is \ndetermined by his own karmas.  As for a bhakta of Bhagvãn, \nwhatever misery he suffers is due to the negligence in following \nBhagvãn’s ãgnã for the sake of worthless objects.  Whatever \nhappiness he does experience, is a result of following the ãgnã of \nBhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 34 || 34 ||",

    "content": "Krodh, Mãn, Irshyã, And Kapat Leads To A Demonic Intellect \n \n35.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Posh vad 12 [12th January, 1820], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting facing east on a decorated \nbedstead under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree \nVãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was \ndressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n35.2 Addressing the munis, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Either you ask me a \nquestion, or I shall ask you a question.” \n \n35.3 The munis said, “Mahãrãj, please ask.” \n \n35.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Suppose there is a person who does not \nfalter when it comes to protecting his own kalyãn, despite having \nlittle intelligence.  On the other hand, there is another person who is \nvery intelligent – to the extent that he can point out mistakes even in \ngreat men.  But, he does not walk on the path of kalyãn.  What is the \nreason for this?” \n \n35.5 The munis attempted to answer, but as Shreeji Mahãrãj raised \ndoubts, they were unable to provide a precise answer. \n \n35.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Allow me to answer.  Such a person may \nbe highly intelligent, but his intelligence is polluted.  As a result, he is \nGADHADÃ I \n- 92 - \nunable to walk on the path of kalyãn.  For example, suppose there is \nsome sweet, tasty buffalo-milk.  If a snake’s venom were to fall in it, \nthen that milk and sugar would become poisonous.  Whoever drinks \nit, would die.  Similarly, such a person may be highly intelligent, but \nhe has identified avgun in a great sant or Bhagvãn.  The avgun that \nhas entered his mind is equivalent to the snake’s venom.  So, how can \nhe possibly walk on the path of kalyãn?  In fact, even if someone were \nto listen to his talks, the listener’s mind would also fall back from \nsatsang.  \n \n35.7 “A person possessing such a polluted intelligence in this way, \nperceives avgun in Bhagvãn and His bhaktas, wherever he takes \nbirth.  On the other hand, a person who does not have a polluted \nintelligence, but has little intelligence, does not falter in protecting \nhis kalyãn.” \n \n35.8 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “Mahãrãj, can a person with such a \npolluted intellect ever turn towards Bhagvãn?” \n \n35.9 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “No, he never turns towards Bhagvãn.” \n \n35.10 Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, please tell us how we can avoid \ndeveloping such a demonic intellect.” \n \n35.11 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “If a person does not keep the following \nfour svabhãvs with Bhagvãn and His sant, then his intellect will never \nbecome demonic: krodh, mãn, irshyã, kapat.  If he keeps even one of \nthese four, then his intellect will become demonic, just like Jay and \nVijay.  Despite being wise, their intellect became demonic, because \nthey showed mãn towards the Sanakãdik.  As a result, they both fell \nfrom Vaikunth. \n \n35.12 “Furthermore, when a person’s intellect becomes demonic, even the \ngun of Bhagvãn and His bhakta appear as faults to him.  Wherever \nGADHADÃ I \n- 93 - \nsuch a person takes birth, he becomes an attendant of Shiv or the \nking of demons, and does bhajan of Bhagvãn with hatred.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 35 || 35 ||",

    "content": "A Tyãgi Must Only Have Love For Bhagvãn \n \n36.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Posh vad 13 [13th January, 1820], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the platform under \nthe neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in \nDãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes, with garlands of white and yellow flowers adorning His neck.  \nBunches of white flowers were placed on both of His ears, and a \ntassel of yellow flowers was hanging from His pãgh.  A chhoglu made \nfrom red karnikãr flowers had also been placed in His pãgh.  Also, He \nwas playing with a ball of white flowers with His right hand.  To the \njoy of His bhaktas, He was sitting in a charming fashion.  A sabhã of \nmunis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n36.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “How should a person view a person who \nhas abandoned worldly life and accepted the clothing of a tyãgi, yet \nstill has affection for useless objects?  He should be viewed to be like \na poor person beside a wealthy person.  Suppose there is a poor \nperson who has no clothes to wear and feeds himself by scavenging \nfor scraps of food from piles of waste, not only does he consider \nhimself to be a sinner, but other wealthy people also consider him to \nbe a sinner.  They presume, ‘He must have committed many sins, which \nis why he has no food or clothes’. \n \n36.3 “Similarly, after becoming a tyãgi, a person who collects nice clothes \nand other pleasant objects with a strong craving for them, but does \nGADHADÃ I \n- 94 - \nnot have affection for dharma, gnãn, vairãgya, and bhakti, is \nconsidered by the great ekãntik sant to be a sinner just like the poor \nperson.  As he is a sinner, he does not have love for dharma, gnãn, \nvairãgya, and bhakti.  Instead, he has affection for objects other than \nBhagvãn. \n \n36.4 “However, for a true tyãgi both dirt and gold are equal.  Also, a tyãgi \nnever makes distinctions by thinking, ‘This object is pleasant, and this \nobject is unpleasant’.  He never has such an understanding.  Instead, \nhe has love only towards Bhagvãn.  Only such a person is a true \ntyãgi.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 36 || 36 ||",

    "content": "Detachment From Birthplace And Relatives \n \n37.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Posh vad 14 [14th January, 1820], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was sitting facing west on a decorated bedstead under the \nneem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a white pãgh, from \nwhich hung a tassel of yellow flowers.  Bunches of white flowers had \nalso been placed upon both of His ears, and a garland of yellow and \nwhite flowers adorned His neck.  He had covered Himself with a \nwhite chãdar, and was wearing a white khes.  A sabhã of munis, as \nwell as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n37.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A person who lacks understanding \ncannot abandon his feelings of affection for his birthplace even \nthough he has abandoned the world.”  So saying, He showed \neveryone the scar on His thigh where He had been injured by the \nbroken branch of a tree during His childhood.  Shreeji Mahãrãj then \ncontinued, “Whenever I see this scar, I remember the tree and the \nlake.  Therefore, it is extremely difficult to forget your birthplace and \nGADHADÃ I \n- 95 - \nrelatives.  I would like those amongst you, who do not remember \nyour birthplace and relations, to confess.  For those of you, who do \nnot speak up out of shame, take oath on the name of Nar-Nãrãyan.” \n \n37.3 Then, all the munis revealed what was true for them. \n \n37.4 After listening to them, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “If a person believes \nhimself to be the ãtmã, where is the birthplace of that ãtmã?  Who \nare the relatives of that ãtmã?  Of what gender is that ãtmã?  \nMoreover, if you wish to maintain relationships with your relatives, \nthen you should also maintain relationships with all the relatives that \nyou have had throughout your previous lives in the cycle of 8.4 \nmillion life-forms.  Furthermore, if a person wishes for the kalyãn of \nhis relatives, then he should wish the same for all.  However, just as \nupon beginning this human life the parents of the previous 8.4 \nmillion life-forms have all been forgotten due to ignorance, similarly \nthe parents of this human body should be forgotten through \nknowledge. \n \n37.5 “As for me, I have no affection towards any of my relatives.  \nMoreover, a person may be serving me, but if there is no bhakti for \nBhagvãn in his heart, I cannot develop a liking for him – even if I try.  \nEven if he is as virtuous as Nãradji, if he lacks bhakti for Bhagvãn, I do \nnot like him.   \n \n37.6 “On the other hand, there is a person who has bhakti for Bhagvãn in \nhis heart.  He understands that the way in which pratyaksha Bhagvãn \nresides on this earth, and the way in which the bhakta of Bhagvãn \nremains in the vicinity of Bhagvãn, is exactly how they remain when \nãtyantik-pralay occurs.  He also understands that Bhagvãn and His \nbhakta is eternally sãkãr, but never does he understand them to be \nnirãkãr, regardless of any Vedãnt shãstra he may hear.  Furthermore, \nhe realises that no one besides Bhagvãn sustains the world, and he \nalso realises that without Bhagvãn, even a dry leaf cannot be stirred. \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 96 - \n37.7 “A person with such firm belief that Bhagvãn is sãkãr, even an \nordinary person, is still dear to me.  Kãl, karma, and Mãyã are unable \nto use their power over him.  In fact, Bhagvãn Himself instructs any \npunishment that he is to receive, but no one else has any authority \nover him.  On the other hand, I have no respect for a person without \nsuch a belief, even if he happens to have the qualities of tyãg and \nvairãgya.  However, a person with firm belief in Bhagvãn in his heart \nnever loses his belief that Bhagvãn is sãkãr, nor does he ever \nunderstand Bhagvãn to be nirãkãr like a mass of light, regardless of \nhow many shãstras he may hear or the company he may keep.  A sant \nwith such a belief is so highly respected by me that even I place the \ndust on his holy feet on my head.  In my mind, I am afraid of harming \nhim, and I also long to have his darshan. \n \n37.8 “A person without this belief attempts to attain kalyãn using the \nstrength of his own spiritual activities, but he does not strive for it by \nrelying on the grace of Bhagvãn.  Such a senseless person is as foolish \nas someone wishing to cross the ocean without the aid of a ship, by \nhis own efforts.  Conversely, a person who wishes for kalyãn through \nthe grace of Bhagvãn is wise, like a person who wishes to cross the \nocean with the help of a ship. \n \n37.9 “After leaving their body, all those with such knowledge of Bhagvãn’s \nsvarup attain a murti of chaitanya in the home of Bhagvãn and \nforever remain in His sevã in His presence.  But if a person has \nattempted to attain kalyãn without having such a belief, then he will \ngo to dwell in the loks of other devs. \n \n37.10 “In fact, the darshan of such a true bhakta of Bhagvãn is equivalent to \nthe darshan of Bhagvãn Himself.  He is so great that his darshan alone \ncan redeem countless wretched jeevs.” \n37.11 Having delivered these talks, Shreeji Mahãrãj requested, “Now please \nsing a kirtan.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 37 || 37 || \nGADHADÃ I \n- 97 -",

    "content": "Remove Vãsnã Before You Perform Bhakti \n \n \n \n38.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Mahã sud 1 [16th January, \n1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a small mattress which had \nbeen placed on the veranda outside the stables in Dãdã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes and had tied a \nwhite, red-bordered feto around His head.  He was also wearing a \nrichly embroidered angarkhu and had covered Himself with a white \nchofãl.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n38.2 After glancing at all the haribhaktas, Shreeji Mahãrãj thought for \nsome time and then said, “Please listen, as I have something to say.” \n \n38.3 He then continued, “From the time a satsangi enters the satsang, he \nshould examine his mind by thinking ‘In the first year, my mind was \nlike this, then it was like this.  Previously, I had this much desire for \nBhagvãn and this much desire for the world’.  In this way, he should \nrepeatedly reflect on his yearly total of desires and always attempt to \ngradually, yet constantly eradicate all worldly desires that remain in \nthe mind.  However, if he does not assess himself constantly, and \nallows those desires to accumulate, then they will never be \novercome.  Consider the analogy of opening an account with a \nmerchant:  If a person settles the debts regularly on a monthly basis, \nthen it will not be difficult to repay the debt.  But, if he waits until the \nend of the year to repay the debt, it will be extremely difficult to \nsettle the account.  Likewise, a person should assess himself \nconstantly. \n \n38.4 “In reality, the mind is saturated with desires for the world.  In the \nway that sesame seeds are permeated with scent by padding them \nbetween alternating layers of flowers, the mind should be saturated \nwith flowers in the form of the constant remembrance of Bhagvãn’s \nGADHADÃ I \n- 98 - \ncharitra, together with an understanding of His greatness.  These \ncharitras and thoughts of Bhagvãn should be entangled within the \nmind.  As one thought subsides, another should be visualised.  In this \nway, the mind should not be left idle.”  Saying this, Shreeji Mahãrãj \nnarrated a story of a ghost.” \n \n38.5 He then continued, “Even if a person begins to recall the charitras, \ntalks, and darshan of Bhagvãn of just one day, there would be no end \nto them.  If that is so, then there would certainly be no end to them \nfor someone who has passed ten to fifteen years in satsang. \n \n38.6 “These charitras should be recalled in the following way: ‘In this way, \nMahãrãj and the paramhans held sabhã in this village; in this way, pujã \nwas offered to Mahãrãj; in this way, talks were done’.  Those charitras \nof Bhagvãn should be recalled over and over again.  Moreover, for a \nperson who does not have much understanding, this is certainly the \nbest method for them.  In fact, there is no other method like it. \n \n38.7 “Then, you may say, ‘We wish to take very little food and wish to keep \nmany fasts’.  But, I do not emphasise those methods.  A person should \nabide by those methods as best as he can in accordance with his \ngiven niyams.  But, what I have just described to you is what should \ntruly be done.” \n \n38.8 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “I believe that the mind should be free of \nworldly desires.  No matter how much pravrutti a person may do \nphysically, if his mind is pure, then he cannot be seriously harmed – \neven though outwardly, in society, a person engaged in pravrutti \nappears to be dishonourable.  On the other hand, if a person’s mind is \nfull of worldly desires and he superficially behaves as if he is \npracticing nivrutti, then he may appear respectable in society, but his \njeev will suffer severely.  This is because at the time of death, it is \nthose thoughts that are in a person’s mind that spring forth, just like \nthe child of a deer sprang forth in Bharatji’s mind during his last \nGADHADÃ I \n- 99 - \nmoments.  As a result, he became a deer in his next life, even though \nhe had originally given up a kingdom and Rushabh-Dev Bhagvãn was \nhis father.  Therefore, to remain mentally free of worldly desires is \nmy belief.  By keeping fasts, the mind does become weak along with \nthe body; but, when the body becomes strong again, the mind also \nbecomes strong.  Therefore, mental tyãg is required along with \nphysical tyãg.  In fact, a person whose mind holds thoughts of \nBhagvãn but not thoughts relating to the world should be considered \nimportant in our satsang.  Conversely, those who do not do this are \ninferior. \n \n38.9 “Furthermore, a grahastha should engage in worldly activities \nphysically, but mentally he should also remain free of worldly \ndesires, just like the tyãgi, and should think of Bhagvãn.  Also, he \nshould engage in social activities according to the ãgnã of Bhagvãn.  \nMoreover, if mental tyãg is not genuine, then what about Janak Rãjã, \nwhose mind was like that of a great yogi master, despite ruling a \nkingdom?  Therefore, only tyãg which is developed mentally, is \nappropriate.” \n \n38.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “If impure thoughts arise in a \nperson’s mind, he should reveal them.  But, as the saying goes, ‘Only a \ndog will lick a dog’s face’, or ‘When a snake is a guest to another snake, \nthe host-snake will have nothing to offer, so the guest-snake lick’s the \nhost-snake’s face’, or when a married woman goes to a widow, the \nwidow says, ‘Come, lady.  May you also become like me’.  Similarly, to \nreveal impure thoughts to someone who also experiences impure \nthoughts is like the examples mentioned. \n \n38.11 “Then, to whom should a person reveal his impure thoughts?  Well, \nhe should reveal them to a person who is so strong-willed, that no \nimpure thoughts relating to the world arise in his mind.  However, \nthere may be many who do not experience such thoughts.  So, out of \nthose, a person should reveal his impure thoughts to a person who \nGADHADÃ I \n- 100 - \ncriticises those thoughts after listening to them and who continues to \ncriticise them in all of his activities – while eating, drinking, sitting, \nstanding – until they are eradicated from his mind.  Moreover, that \nperson should have the same determination to eradicate others’ \nimpure thoughts as he has to remove his own.  A person should \nreveal his impure thoughts to such a person.  But, if the person to \nwhom he reveals his impure thoughts does not give advice in this \nway and is himself careless, then what can someone gain from him?  \nTherefore, after revealing impure thoughts in this way and \neradicating them, a person should continuously hold thoughts only of \nBhagvãn and become free from all desires for the pleasures of the \nworld.” \n \n38.12 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “What are the characteristics of keeping a \nfast on a day of Ekãdashi?  Well, the ten indriyas and the mind, the \neleventh, should be withdrawn from their respective vishays and \nattached to Bhagvãn.  That is considered as having kept an Ekãdashi \nfast.  In fact, bhaktas of Bhagvãn should engage in this continuously.  \nIn comparison, if a person whose mind is not free from worldly \ndesires in this way physically engages in vrat and tap, he does not \nbenefit very much.  Therefore, following his own dharma and \nunderstanding Bhagvãn’s greatness, a bhakta of Bhagvãn should \nmaintain a constant effort to free his mind of worldly desires.” \n \n38.13 Shreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “A true tyãgi is a person whose mind \nnever thinks about a desire for objects that he has already given up.  \nJust as a person has no desire for faeces once they have been \nexcreted, in the same way, no desire arises for rejected objects.  \nNãradji narrated to Shukji: \n \ntyaja dharmama-dharma cha \n \nThe essence of the shlok is: ‘A person should abandon all objects except \nthe ãtmã; he should behave only as the ãtmã and worship Bhagvãn’.  \nSuch a person can be called a perfect tyãgi.  Furthermore, grahastha \nGADHADÃ I \n- 101 - \nharibhaktas should behave like Janak Rãjã, who said, ‘Although my \ncity of Mithilã is burning, nothing of mine is burning’, as stated in the \nfollowing shlok:  \n \nmithilãyãm pradeep-tãyam na me dahyati kinchana \n \nA grahastha haribhakta with this type of understanding, even though \nhe may possess a house, is a true haribhakta.  A person who is not \nsuch a tyãgi or grahastha is called a false bhakta, whereas a person \nwho behaves as described above should be known as an ekãntik \nbhakta.” \n \n38.14 Then, Motã Ãtmãnand Swãmi asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “What are the \ncharacteristics of the jeevãtmã, which is distinct from the body, the \nindriyas, the antah-karans, and their presiding devs?” \n \n38.15 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “I shall answer that question in brief.  The \njeev is the speaker that explains the nature of the body and the \nindriyas, and explains their natures separately to the listener.  That \nspeaker is the knower of everything, and is distinct from all the above \n– that is called the jeev.  Also, the listener, which understands the \nforms of the body and the indriyas as being distinct, which knows \nthem, and which is distinct from them all, is also known as the jeev \nitself.  This is the method of understanding the nature of the jeev.”  \nShreeji Mahãrãj spoke in this way. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 38 || 38 ||",

    "content": "Nirvikalp Or Savikalp Samãdhi \n \n39.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Mahã sud 3 [18th January, 1820], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the platform under \nthe neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in \nDãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes and \nGADHADÃ I \n- 102 - \nhad covered Himself with a white chãdar.  He had tied a white pãgh \naround His head, from which tassels of yellow flowers were dangling.  \nBunches of white and yellow flowers had been placed above His ears, \nand He was wearing garlands of yellow flowers around His neck.  A \nsabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \n39.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then asked a question to a vedãnti brãhman who was \nsitting in the sabhã, “You claim that only Brahm exists.  Furthermore, \nyou say that with the exception of that Brahm, jeevs, ishvars, Mãyã, \nthe world, the Veds, six-shãstras, and the Purãns, are all false.  I can \nneither understand this concept of yours, nor can I accept it.  \nTherefore, please answer what I ask you, and do so by citing only the \nVeds, the six-shãstras, the Purãns, the Smrutis, or other historical \nshãstras.  However, if you reply quoting the words of some \ninauthentic shãstra, then I will not accept your answer.  But, since I \nhave absolute faith in the words of Vyãsji, I will be able to accept your \nanswer if you reply quoting his words.” \n \n39.3 The vedãnti then attempted to reply using various arguments, but as \nShreeji Mahãrãj had raised doubts, the question remained \nunanswered. \n \n39.4 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please listen as I answer that question \nmyself.  There are two different states of those who have become \nmuktas by worshipping Bhagvãn.  For example, a person standing on \ntop of Mount Meru clearly sees everything in the vicinity of Meru – \nthe other mountains, trees, as well as the ground that supports the \nmountains and the trees.  Similarly, those enlightened muktas who \nhave attained savikalp samãdhi, see jeevs, ishvars, Mãyã, and their \nsupporter (Brahm), as being separate from each other.  A person \nstanding on top of Mount Lokã-Lok, sees everything in the vicinity of \nMount Lokã-Lok, but sees the other mountains and trees, as being \none with the ground.  He does not see them as being separate.  \nGADHADÃ I \n- 103 - \nSimilarly, those great muktas who have attained nirvikalp samãdhi \nsee jeevs, ishvars, and Mãyã as Brahm, but they do not see them as \nseparate entities. \n \n39.5 “In this way, there are two differing states of muktas, and it is due to \ntheir differing states that everything is viewed as being either satya \nor asatya.  The words of those who have attained the savikalp state \nare noted in the Veds, the six-shãstras, and the Purãns, and they \ndescribe all of those entities as being satya.  However, the words of \nthose who have attained the nirvikalp state describe all of those \nentities as asatya.  In reality, they are not asatya.  They are only \ndescribed as being asatya because they cannot be seen due to the \ninfluence of the nirvikalp state. \n \n39.6 “For example, there is no night for a person sitting in the chariot of \nSurya.  But, for those on earth, there is both day and night.  Similarly, \nfrom the viewpoint of a person who has attained the nirvikalp state, \nall the things do not exist, whereas according to others, they do exist.  \nSo, if a person interprets ‘Brahm’ in this way, then there will never be \nany irregularities in the statements of the shãstras.  But, if a person \ndoes not, then irregularities will arise.  Furthermore, if a person – \nwithout having understood these inconsistencies and without having \nattained that nirvikalp state, relying solely on words learned from the \nshãstras – promotes the existence of Brahm alone, claiming that the \nguru, the shishya, jeevs, ishvars, Mãyã, the world, the Veds, the Purãns, \nand the shãstras, are all imaginary, then he is extremely foolish.  \nUltimately, such a person will be sent to Narak.” \n \n39.7 Having answered the question, Shreeji Mahãrãj ended by asking the \nbrãhman, “Now, if you have any doubts in what I have just said, \nplease say so.” \n \n39.8 Then, the vedãnti brãhman replied, “O Mahãrãj, O Prabhu, O Swãmi!  \nYou are Bhagvãn, and you have incarnated for the kalyãn of the entire \nworld.  The explanation you have given is of course precise.  There is \nGADHADÃ I \n- 104 - \nno room for any doubt.”  So saying, he became extremely pleased, and \nafter abandoning his misconceptions, he became an ãshrit of Shreeji \nMahãrãj. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 39 || 39 ||",

    "content": "The Characteristics Of Bhakti And Upãsanã \n \n40.1 In the Samvat year 1876, in the early hours of Mahã sud 4 [19th \nJanuary, 1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead \nunder the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan \nin Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes \nand had covered Himself with a white chãdar.  He had tied a white \npãgh around His head, with a tassel of yellow flowers hanging from it.  \nHe was wearing a garland of yellow flowers around His neck.  A \nsabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \n40.2 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “What is savikalp \nsamãdhi, and what is nirvikalp samãdhi?” \n \n40.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “If a person who has sthiti in the svarup of \nBhagvãn does not have any impure desires, but does have some pure \ndesires.  For example, ‘I wish to become like Nãrad, the Sanakãdik and \nShukji’, or ‘I wish to go to the ãshram of Nar-Nãrãyan and stay with the \nmunis there to perform tap’, or ‘I wish to go to Shvet-Dvip and become \nlike a mukta of Shvet-Dvip by performing tap’ – then such a person is \nsaid to be in savikalp samãdhi.  On the other hand, a person who does \nnot have such thoughts, has attained the characteristics of Akshar-\nBrahm, and remains engaged only in the murti of Bhagvãn, is said to \nbe in nirvikalp samãdhi.” \n \n40.4 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked again, “Mahãrãj, what is the \ndifference between bhakti and upãsanã?” \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 105 - \n40.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied: \n \nshravanam kirtanam vishnoha smaranam pãd-sevanam \narchanam vandanam dãsyam sakhyam ãtma-nivedanam \nNine ways of offering bhakti to Bhagvãn: shravan, kirtan, smaran , pãd sevan, \narchan, vandan, dãsya, sakhya, ãtma-nivedan. \n \n“To worship Bhagvãn in these nine ways is known as bhakti. \n \n40.6 “Upãsanã can be defined as having a firm belief that Bhagvãn’s svarup \nis sãkãr.  Even if a person becomes brahm-rup, that belief never \ndisappears.  Moreover, even if he happens to listen to shãstras \nproposing the view that Bhagvãn is nirãkãr, he would still \nunderstand Bhagvãn to always be sãkãr.  Regardless of what is \nmentioned in the shãstras, he would only promote Bhagvãn’s svarup \nas sãkãr, never allowing his own upãsanã to be disproved.  A person \nwho has such a firm understanding is considered to possess \nupãsanã.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 40 || 40 ||",

    "content": "Purushottam Bhagvãn Resides In All \n \n41.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Mahã sud 5 [20th January, \n1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the \nplatform under the neem tree near the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-\nNãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  He was also wearing garland of yellow \nflowers.  Bunches of yellow flowers had been placed above His ears, \nand tassels of yellow flowers were dangling from His pãgh.  A sabhã \nof munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n41.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please engage in a question-answer \ndiscussion.” \nGADHADÃ I \n- 106 - \n41.3 Nrusinhãnand Swãmi then said, \n \nekoham bahu shyãm prajãyeya \n \n  \n“Many pandits and vedãntis in the world interpret this Vedic shlok to \nmean: ‘The one Bhagvãn present at the time of destruction, Himself \ntakes the form of all jeevs and ishvars by His own will’.  But this belief \ncan only be accepted by someone who is a fool.  We have accepted \nyour refuge, so this belief does not make sense in our minds.  Our \nunderstanding is that Bhagvãn is achyut, and that he does not divide \nand assume the svarups of various jeevs and ishvars.  Therefore, we \ncan only fully understand the meaning of this shlok if you explain it to \nus.” \n \n41.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “The meaning of that Vedic shlok is \nnot as they interpret it to be.  In fact, it has a different meaning \naltogether.  In the Ved-Stuti, it is stated:  \n \nsvakruta-vichitra-yonishu  vishan-niva hetutayã \ntaratam-tash-cha-kãstyanala-vatsva krutãnu-krutihi \n \nThis means: ‘Purushottam Bhagvãn creates and enters the various \ntypes of life-forms as their cause, He is antaryãmi, and He inspires them \nto a greater or lesser degree’. \n \n41.5 “More specifically, at the time of creation, Purushottam Bhagvãn, who \nis greater than even Akshar, looks towards Akshar.  As a result, \nPurush incarnates from Akshar.  After entering Akshar, Purushottam \nenters Purush, and in the form of Purush, inspires Prakruti.  In this \nway, as Purushottam successively entered the various entities, the \nactivities of creation took place.  Then, Pradhãn-Purush were \nproduced from Prakruti-Purush.  From Pradhãn-Purush, maha-tattva \nwas produced.  From maha-tattva, the three types of ahankãr were \nproduced.  From ahankãr, the bhuts, the vishays, the indriyas, the \nantah-karans, and their presiding devs were produced.  From those, \nGADHADÃ I \n- 107 - \nVirãt-Purush was produced, and from the lotus extending from his \nnaval, Brahmã was produced.  From that Brahmã, Marichi and other \nprajãpatis were produced.  From them, Indra and other devs, the \ndemons, and all the sthãvar and jangam creatures were produced. \n \n41.6 “Purushottam Bhagvãn enters and dwells in all the above as their \ncause, and is antaryãmi.  However, He does not reside in Prakruti-\nPurush to the extent that He resides in Akshar.  He does not reside in \nPradhãn-Purush to the extent that He resides in Prakruti-Purush.  He \ndoes not reside in maha-tattva and the rest of the twenty-four tattvas \nto the extent that He resides in Pradhãn-Purush.  He does not reside \nin Virãt-Purush to the extent that He resides in the twenty-four \ntattvas.  He does not reside in Brahmã to the extent that He resides in \nVirãt-Purush.  He does not reside in those like Marichi to the extent \nthat He resides in Brahmã.  He does not reside in Kashyap to the \nextent that He resides in Marichi.  He does not reside in Indra and the \nother devs to the extent that He resides in Kashyap.  He does not \nreside in human beings to the extent that He resides in Indra and the \nother devs.  He does not reside in animals and birds to the extent that \nHe resides in human beings.  In this way, Purushottam Bhagvãn \nresides in all – to a greater or lesser degree – as their cause, and is \nantaryãmi. \n \n41.7 “For example, fire resides within wood.  Large fire resides in large \npieces of wood, long fire resides in a long piece of wood, and bent fire \nresides in a bent piece of wood.  In a similar way, Purushottam \nBhagvãn resides in various entities with varying degrees of power \naccording to the task to be accomplished through that entity.  \n \n41.8 “Purushottam Bhagvãn also resides in those like Akshar and Prakruti-\nPurush, and is antaryãmi.  However, because of the difference in the \nabilities of those entities, there is a difference in their power.  So, \nthere is only one Purushottam Bhagvãn, and it is He who enters all \nand resides in them as antaryãmi.  But, He Himself does not become \nGADHADÃ I \n- 108 - \nthe jeevs and ishvars by assuming many svarups.  This is how that \nVedic shlok should be interpreted.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 41 || 41 ||",

    "id": "Gadhadã I – 42",
    "title": "Vidhi And Nishedh",
    "content": "Vidhi And Nishedh \n \n42.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Mahã sud 6 [21st January, 1820], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was sitting facing west on a decorated bedstead on the \nplatform under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-\nNãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He had tied a white \npãgh around His head.  He had also covered Himself with a white \nchãdar and was wearing a white khes.  Bunches of yellow flowers had \nbeen placed above both of His ears.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n42.2 Seated in the sabhã, were some vedãnti brãhmans.  Seeing them, \nShreeji Mahãrãj said, “Those who study or listen to the Vedãnt \nshãstras claim, ‘The vidhi and nishedh are false; Svarg and Narak, \nwhich are attained by following them, are also false; the disciples who \nattain them are false; and the guru is false as well.  Brahm pervades \neverything and it alone is satya’.  But, those who speak in this way, \nwith what understanding do they propose this? \n42.3 “In actual fact, the ãchãrya of all vedãntis, Shankar-Ãchãrya, had his \nown disciples keep a cane and a kamandalu.  He also enforced, ‘A \nperson should recite the Bhagvad Geetã and the Vishnu-Sahasranãm; a \nperson should perform pujã of Vishnu; those who are young should bow \ndown to those who are senior in age; and a person should beg for alms \nonly from the house of a religious and pure brãhman’.  So, because \nShankar-Ãchãrya proposed the following of various vidhi and nishedh \nin this way, can you claim that he did not have complete gnãn?  Have \nthose who claim to have recently attained gnãn, and have falsified the \nfollowing of these vidhi and nishedh, become greater than Shankar-\nGADHADÃ I \n- 109 - \nÃchãrya?  Actually, it seems as if they are speaking out of absolute \nfoolishness. \n \n42.4 “In reality, those vidhi and nishedh that have been falsified in the \nshãstras, can be understood through the following example:  If a large \nship sets out to sea for a year, then neither the shoreline ahead nor \nthe shoreline behind can be seen.  In fact, even huge mountains on \neither shoreline cannot be seen, so how can trees or people possibly \nbe seen?  Wherever a person looks, only water can be seen; but \nbesides water, nothing else is visible.  If he looks up, the enormous \nwaves of the ocean rising up will be seen.  So even above, only water \nis visible.  In this situation, people sitting in the ship would claim that \nthere is only water, and nothing else exists.  The principle behind this \nexample is that a person who has attained a nirvikalp state in the \nform of Brahm claims, ‘There is only Brahm; besides that everything \nelse, such as jeevs, ishvars, and Mãyã, is false’.  Hearing words written \nin the shãstras supporting this view, a person who has not even \nattained that state, claims all vidhi and nishedh are false.  He thinks of \nhis wife and children, and carries out all social activities while \nbelieving them to be true.  Therefore, he believes the vidhi and \nnishedh, which are written in the shãstras, to be false.  Those who \npreach such gnãn in this world should be known as extremely sinful \nand nãstiks. \n \n42.5 “After all, it was because of the uneasiness that such a nãstik nature \nmay creep into people’s hearts, that Shankar-Ãchãrya composed \nmany shloks in the praise of Vishnu, such as:  \n \nbhaja govindam bhaja govindam govindam bhaja mudhamate \nO fool!  Worship Bhagvãn...Worship Bhagvãn...Worship Bhagvãn. \n \n“He also composed several shloks praising Shivji, Ganpati, Surya, and \nmany other devs.  After hearing these shloks, all the devs appear to be \nsatya.  It was with this intention in mind that Shankar-Ãchãrya \ncomposed shloks in praise of all these devs.  Despite this, scholars of \nGADHADÃ I \n- 110 - \ntoday falsify them.  In addition, they claim, ‘Regardless of how severe a \nsin a person with gnãn may commit, it would not affect him’.  But, they \nsay this out of foolishness. \n \n42.6 “Also, consider this: From all those tyãgi paramhans, Jadbharat is the \nbest.  In fact, the story of Jadbharat has been noted in each of the \nPurãns and all the Vedãnt shãstras.  That great Jadbharat was also the \nson of Rushabh-Dev Bhagvãn in his previous life.  He gave up his \nkingdom, and went to live in the forest.  There, he developed \naffection for a deer.  Although that was merely out of compassion, \nthis mistake caused him to be reborn as a deer.  Like that deer, he \nattained four legs, a short tail, and small horns on his head. \n \n42.7 “In comparison, the gopis of Vraj were attached to Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn out of lust.  Despite this, they were still able to overcome \nBhagvãn’s mãyã, and attain the nirgun Akshardhãm of Bhagvãn after \nbecoming gunãtit.  The reason for this was that Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn was Purushottam, and He was a gunãtit divya murti.  So, \nbecause the gopis developed love for Him, either knowingly or \nunknowingly, they became gunãtit as well.  However, Bharatji \nbecame a deer because he had developed affection for the deer out of \ncompassion.  Therefore, no matter how great a person may be, \nkusang only leads to harm.  Conversely, regardless of how great a \nsinner a person may be, if he maintains profound association with \nBhagvãn, who is satya, then that person also becomes absolutely \npure and attains kalyãn.  Of course, if Shree Krishna Bhagvãn was not \ngunãtit himself, then His bhaktas, the gopis, would not have attained \nthe gunãtit state.  But, because they did attain the gunãtit state, Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn was most certainly flawless, gunãtit, and divya. \n \n42.8 “Vedãntis also claim, ‘Everything is pervaded by Brahm’.  Just as the \ngopis developed love for Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, all women develop \nlove for their husbands, and all men develop love for their wives.  \nHowever, they do not attain what the gopis attained.  Instead, they \nGADHADÃ I \n- 111 - \nattain gloomy Narak.  Therefore, those who prescribe that vidhi and \nnishedh are indeed true, not false; and whoever falsifies them, will be \nconsigned to Narak.” \n \n42.9 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj bid “Jay Sachidãnand” to everyone, \nand returned to His residence. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 42 || 42 ||",

    "content": "The Four Types Of Mukti \n \n43.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Mahã sud 7 [22nd January, \n1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the \nveranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He had tied a white pãgh around His head.  He had covered \nHimself with a white chãdar and was wearing a white khes as well.  \nTassels of yellow flowers were dangling from His pãgh, and garlands \nof yellow flowers adorned His neck.  Also, bunches of yellow flowers \nhad been placed above both of His ears.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n43.2 Looking at all the bhaktas with a compassionate gaze, Shreeji \nMahãrãj said, “I wish to ask a question, so please listen.”  He then \nbegan, “The Shreemad Bhãgvat Purãn states, ‘Those who are bhaktas \nof Bhagvãn do not desire any of the four types of mukti’.  Other great \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn also say, ‘Bhaktas of Bhagvãn do not wish for the \nfour types of mukti’.  What are the four types of mukti?  The first type \nis to reside in the dhãm of Bhagvãn; the second type is to stay near \nBhagvãn; the third type is to assume a svarup similar to Bhagvãn; and \nthe forth type is to attain powers similar to Bhagvãn.  These are the \nfour types of mukti.  A bhakta of Bhagvãn does not wish for any of \nthese.  Instead he only wishes to serve Bhagvãn.  Now, my question \nGADHADÃ I \n- 112 - \nis, ‘Why does that bhakta not wish for the four types of mukti?’  Please \nanswer according to your ability.” \n \n43.3 All the paramhans attempted to answer the question, but were \nunable to do so adequately. \n \n43.4 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Here, I shall answer the question.  A \nperson who maintains a desire for the four types of mukti after \nbecoming a bhakta of Bhagvãn is known as a ‘sakãm bhakta’.  In \ncontrast, a person who has no desires regarding the four types of \nmukti, and who only desires to serve Bhagvãn, is known as a ‘nishkãm \nbhakta’.  In fact, the Shreemad Bhãgvat states:  \n \nmat-sevaya prateetam cha sãlokyãdi chatushtayam \nnechhanti sevaya puranahã krutonyat-kãlaviplutam \nIf those who are only fulfilled by serving me do not desire the four types of \nmukti, such as a place in my dhãm, which are attained by serving me – then \nwhy would they desire anything that is ultimately perishable? \n \nsãlokya sãrshti sãmeepya sãrupyaika-tvamapyut \ndeeyamãnam na gruhnanti vinã mat-sevanam janãhã \nEven if granted a place in my dhãm, powers similar to mine, my closeness, a \nsvarup  similar to mine, or oneness with me, nishkãm bhaktas would not \naccept them without my sevã. \n43.5 “This means that a nishkãm bhakta of Bhagvãn does not wish for the \nfour types of mukti, if the sevã of Bhagvãn is not included.  He only \nwishes to serve Bhagvãn.  In turn, Bhagvãn keeps this nishkãm \nbhakta in His own sevã.  Bhagvãn also insists on granting such a \nbhakta with His divine powers and bliss, even though the bhakta \ndoes not wish for them.  Kapil-Dev Bhagvãn has also said: \n \natho vibhutim mama mãyã-vinastã-maishvaryam-ashtãngama-nupravruttam \nshriyam bhagavateem va spruhayanti bhadram parasya me teshnuvate tu loke \nEven though my nishkãm bhaktas have no wish for the material wealth of the \nloks up to and including the lok of Brahmã, for the eight extraordinary powers, \nor for the auspicious wealth of Bhagvãn, they still enjoy all these in my dhãm. \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 113 - \n43.6 “In the Geetã, such a nishkãm bhakta has been referred to as a bhakta \nwith gnãn.  A sakãm bhakta, on the other hand, has been referred to \nas materialistic.  Therefore, a bhakta should not wish for anything \nexcept the sevã of Bhagvãn.  After all, wishing for anything other than \nthe sevã of Bhagvãn is considered to be a flaw.  It should be overcome \nby extreme association with the nishkãm ekãntik bhakta of Bhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 43 || 43 ||",

    "content": "The Characteristics Of Love \n \n44.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the morning of Mahã sud 8 [23rd January, \n1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting facing west on a decorated \nbedstead on the platform under the neem tree in front of the mandir \nof Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas wearing a white khes, and had covered Himself with a white \nchãdar.  Also, He had tied a white feto around His head, and had tied a \nbokãni with one end of the feto.  A garland of white flowers decorated \nthe feto.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n44.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then asked, “What is the characteristic of having love \ntowards Bhagvãn?” \n \n44.3 Brahmãnand Swãmi attempted to describe the characteristic of love, \nbut was unable to do so adequately. \n \n44.4 Hearing his reply, Shreeji Mahãrãj commented, “You have not even \ncome close to describing love.  You say it is remaining detached from \nthe body and the brahmãnd, but that is not the characteristic of love.  \nThat is the characteristic of vairãgya.  In actual fact, love is constantly \nremembering Bhagvãn’s murti.  That is called love. \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 114 - \n44.5 “A bhakta with total love for Bhagvãn, never has any thoughts other \nthan those of Bhagvãn.  The extent to which he holds desires other \nthan those of Bhagvãn, is the extent to which he lacks in his love.  If, \nwhether knowingly or unknowingly, some thoughts other than \nremembering Bhagvãn’s murti were to arise in a person who has true \nlove for Bhagvãn, it would be as distressful for him as someone \nthrowing a handful of pebbles and sand into a delicious meal he is \neating, or as painful as being branded on his forehead by a red-hot \nbranding iron.  A person who feels this way should be known to have \nlove for Bhagvãn.  So now, if all of you examine your hearts, you will \nrealise how much love you have for Bhagvãn.” \n \n44.6 Brahmãnand Swãmi then asked, “By what means can a person \ndevelop such intense love for Bhagvãn?” \n \n44.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Only by keeping profound association with \nthe sat-purush can a person develop intense love for Bhagvãn.” \n \n44.8 At this point, Somlã Khãchar questioned, “But, we are intensely \nengaged in such profound association, yet why does such intense \nlove not develop?” \n \n44.9 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “It is true that you engage yourselves in \nsuch profound association, but as well as associating with me, you \nalso associate with the world.  As a result, intense love for Bhagvãn \ndoes not develop.” \n \n44.10 Then, a brãhman named Vãlo Dhruv, from Vaso, asked a question.  \n“Mahãrãj, how can the feelings of ‘I-ness’ and ‘my-ness’ towards the \nbody and its relations, be eradicated?” \n \n44.11 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The jeev has a misconception that it does \nnot believe itself to be the jeevãtmã, and distinct from the body.  \nInstead, it believes itself to be the body.  To illustrate how the body \nclings to the jeevãtmã, consider a person who wears a dagli after \nGADHADÃ I \n- 115 - \nhaving it sewn by a tailor.  That person then begins to believe, ‘The \ntailor is my father, and the tailor’s wife is my mother’.  Such a person \nwould be considered a fool.  In the same way, the jeevãtmã is given a \ndagli in the form of this body.  That body is born sometimes to a \nbrãhman couple, or sometimes to a low-caste couple, or in any of the \nother 8.4 million life-forms.  Therefore, a person who believes the \nbody to be his true self and believes the parents of that body to be his \nown parents, is called a fool.  He should be considered to be like an \nanimal.  \n \n44.12 “Moreover, out of those 8.4 million life-forms previously undertaken, \nthere is not a single mother, sister, daughter, or wife who keeps the \npati vratã vow any longer.  So, how can a person who believes these \nrelations to be his true relations, ever overcome the feelings of ‘I-\nness’ and ‘my-ness’?  Therefore, without such understanding, to \neradicate attachment for a person’s birthplace and native land, is \nvery difficult indeed. \n \n44.13 “Therefore, as long as a person believes the body to be his true self, \nhis entire understanding is totally useless.  As long as he continues to \nhold pride in his varna and ãshram, he will never see qualities of a \nsãdhu.  So, after discarding the feelings of ‘I-ness’ and ‘my-ness’ for \nthe body and its relations, believing the ãtmã to be brahm-rup, and \nafter abandoning all worldly desires, if a person worships Bhagvãn \nwhile following svadharma, he should be known as a sãdhu.  No \ndistance remains between Purushottam Bhagvãn and a person who \nhas acquired such qualities of a sãdhu.  Everything else may be \npossible, but to acquire such qualities of a sãdhu is extremely \ndifficult.  In fact, I am such a sãdhu, because I do not have even the \nslightest pride in my varna and ãshram.” \n \n44.14 Shreeji Mahãrãj spoke in this way for the purpose of enlightening His \nbhakta.  In reality, He Himself is Purushottam Nãrãyan. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 44 || 44 || \nGADHADÃ I \n- 116 -",

    "content": "Bhagvãn Is Sãkãr And The Light Is Nirãkãr \n \n45.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Mahã sud 10 [24th \nJanuary, 1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting facing south on the \nplatform in front of the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes and had \ncovered Himself with a white chãdar.  He had also tied a white pãgh \naround His head.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n45.2 Gopãlãnand Swãmi then asked, “Mahãrãj, many vedãntis claim that \nBhagvãn is nirãkãr, and does not possess a svarup.  Moreover, they \nquote Vedic shloks that support only that belief.  On the other hand, \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn, such as Nãrad, Shukji, and the Sanakãdik, claim \nthat Bhagvãn is sãkãr.  Of the two, who is correct?” \n \n45.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Purushottam Bhagvãn is eternally sãkãr, \nand that murti is extremely luminous.  The all-pervasive Brahm, \nwhich is antaryãmi and sachidãnand, is actually the divine light of \nPurushottam Bhagvãn, but He Himself possesses a definite murti.  \nThe Shrutis also mention, ‘Bhagvãn looked towards Mãyã’.  Now, if \nBhagvãn sees, does that mean that He has only a pair of eyes and \nnothing else?  He also has hands and feet.  This proves that He is \nsãkãr. \n \n45.4 “Take the example of water.  Its corresponding dev, Varun, is sãkãr in \nhis own home, while water itself is described as nirãkãr.  Also, the \nflames of a fire are described as nirãkãr, while their corresponding \ndev, Agni, is sãkãr in his own home.  Sunlight is also described as \nbeing nirãkãr, while Surya-Dev, who resides in his home, is sãkãr.  \nSimilarly, sachidãnand Brahm is nirãkãr, while Purushottam Bhagvãn \nis sãkãr.  Furthermore, that all-pervasive sachidãnand Brahm, is the \ndivine light of Purushottam Bhagvãn. \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 117 - \n45.5 “Someone may claim that the Shrutis propose that Bhagvãn is all-\npervasive and perfect, and is without features like hands and feet.  \nBut, those Vedic shloks that disprove the features like hands and feet, \nare actually disproving the mãyik hands and feet.  In reality, \nBhagvãn’s murti is divya, not mãyik. \n \n45.6 “When a mirror is placed in front of the sunlight, the reflection is just \nlike the sunlight.  In this way, the light of Purushottam Bhagvãn, \nwhich is sachidãnand Brahm and pervades everything, can also be \nseen as sãkãr, like Purushottam Bhagvãn, by the pure antah-karans \nacting like a mirror. \n \n45.7 “In the same way, Purushottam Bhagvãn is always sãkãr.  He is not \nnirãkãr.  Those who do believe Him to be nirãkãr, just do not \nunderstand.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 45 || 45 ||",

He was wearing a white khes and had \ncovered Himself with a white chãdar.  He had also tied a white pãgh \naround His head.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n46.2 Then, a vedãnti brãhman by the name of Maheshvar Bhatt asked \nShreeji Mahãrãj, “Everything is merged during the state of samãdhi, \nbut how does ãkãsh become merged?” \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 118 - \n46.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Please listen carefully as I explain the \ncharacteristics of ãkãsh in detail.  Ãkãsh is the name given to vacant \nspace.  All objects that exist, reside only within that vacant space.  \nMoreover, ãkãsh pervades and resides within all of those objects.  In \nfact, there is not a single object in which there is no ãkãsh.  It even \nexists in the smallest particle of pruthvi.  If we cut that particle into \nmillions of pieces, ãkãsh will exist within those pieces as well. \n \n46.4 “So, when a person looks from the viewpoint of ãkãsh, the other four \nbhuts cannot be identified; only ãkãsh can be identified.  Everything \nis dependent on that ãkãsh.  The three types of bodies, sthul, sukshma, \nand kãran, stay within ãkãsh.  This brahmãnd also resides within \nãkãsh, along with its creator, Prakruti and Purush.  But that ãkãsh \nalso resides within Prakruti-Purush and their creations, the body and \nthe brahmãnd.  Ãkãsh resides externally as their supporter.  \nTherefore, this ãkãsh is never merged, neither during the state of \nsushupti nor during samãdhi. \n \n46.5 “Someone may argue, ‘The five bhuts have evolved from tamo-gun, so \nhow can that ãkãsh be called the supporter of Prakruti and Purush?  \nAlso, how can it be said to pervade them all?’  Well, if Prakruti did not \ncontain ãkãsh in the form of vacant space, then how could maha-\ntattva – which emerges from Prakruti in the way fruits and flowers \nemerge from a tree, and a calf emerges from a cow’s womb – emerge \nat all?  Therefore, ãkãsh does reside within Prakruti.  Furthermore, \nahankãr also emerges from maha-tattva, so ãkãsh resides within \nmaha-tattva as well.  The three gun emerge from ahankãr, so ãkãsh \nresides within ahankãr as well.  The five bhuts emerge from tamo-\ngun, so ãkãsh resides within tamo-gun as well.  However, the ãkãsh \nthat has evolved from tamo-gun is subject to change, whereas the \nãkãsh that is the support of everything is not subject to change and is \neternal.  It is this ãkãsh that is known as Brahm and as Chidãkãsh, and \nis the supporter of all.  Moreover, it is within this ãkãsh that Purush \nand Prakruti undergo the states of expansion and contraction. \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 119 - \n46.6 “How is this so?  When Purush gazes at Prakruti – just as children are \nborn to a man and woman – with Purush as the husband and Prakruti \nas the wife – children in the form of maha-tattva are produced.  In \nthis way, Prakruti takes the form of the twenty-four tattvas as well as \nthe form of the body and the brahmãnd.  This is her state of \nexpansion.  Purush pervades all entities that evolve from that \nPrakruti, with his powers.  This is his state of expansion. \n \n46.7 “In time, when all the entities that have evolved from Prakruti are \ndestroyed, and Prakruti appears to remain absorbed in Purush’s \nbody, that is Prakruti’s state of contraction.  When Purush reverts \nwithin his own self – at the time when all the entities that have \nevolved from Prakruti are destroyed – that is known as Purush’s state \nof contraction.  For example, when a tortoise expands, all of its limbs \nemerge from its shell; and when it contracts, it withdraws all of its \nlimbs back into its shell and remains totally motionless.  That states \nof expansion and contraction of Prakruti and Purush are similar to \nthis. \n \n46.8 “Also, it is only Purush, and not the all-supporting Chidãkãsh, which \nhas an anvay-vyatirek relationship with Prakruti and the entities \nevolved from her.  After all, how can something that is all-supporting \never be vyatirek from anything?  On the contrary, Purush always \nresides in everything. \n \n46.9 “This brahmãnd is surrounded on all four sides by the Lokã-Lok \nmountains, just like a fort.  Beyond the Lokã-Lok mountains is Ãlok; \nbeyond Ãlok are the seven barriers; beyond that is nothing but \ndarkness; beyond that darkness, there is divine light, which is known \nas Chidãkãsh.  Above, the brahmãnd extends up to Brahm-Lok; above \nwhich are the seven barriers (jad prakruti); above which there is \ndarkness (Mãyã); above which there is again divine light, which is \nknown as Chidãkãsh. \n \n46.10 “Below, brahmãnd extends down to the seventh Pãtãl; below which \nare the seven barriers (jad prakruti); below which there is darkness \nGADHADÃ I \n- 120 - \n(Mãyã); below which there is again divine light, which is known as \nChidãkãsh.  In this way, Chidãkãsh is present on all four sides of the \nbrahmãnd, as well as within the brahmãnd.  When a person’s vision \nreaches the perspective of that all-supporting Chidãkãsh, it is given \nnames like dahar-vidyã or akshi-vidyã.  However, they are all called \nbrahm-vidyã. \n \n46.11  “That Chidãkãsh is extremely luminous and eternal.  It is neither \ncreated nor destroyed.  Whenever there is any mention of the \ncreation and destruction of ãkãsh, it is with reference to the ãkãsh \nthat has evolved from tamo-gun, and which is full of darkness.  This \nãkãsh can be merged, but the all-supporting Chidãkãsh is never \nmerged.  This is the answer to your question.  If anyone still has any \ndoubts please do ask.” \n \n46.12 Then, the vedãnti brãhman and all the haribhaktas replied, “None of \nus have any doubts at all now.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 46 || 46 ||",

    "content": "Characteristics Of Dharma, Bhakti, Gnãn, And Vairãgya \n \n47.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the morning of Mahã sud 12 [26th \nJanuary, 1820], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a \ndecorated bedstead on the platform under the neem tree in front of \nthe mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, \nas well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n47.2 Then, after snapping the fingers of His right hand, Shreeji Mahãrãj \nsaid, “Everyone please listen with attention, as I have something to \ntell you.  What I have to say is simple, but you will only be able to \ngrasp its meaning if you listen carefully.  Otherwise, you will not.” \nGADHADÃ I \n- 121 - \n47.3 All the haribhaktas said, “Please do tell us, Mahãrãj.” \n \n47.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Of Bhagvãn’s bhaktas, some have strength \nin dharma-nishthã, some have strength in ãtmã-nishthã, some have \nstrength in vairãgya-nishthã, and some have strength in bhakti-\nnishthã.  Although a person may have one strength, they also possess \nall the other types, but to a lesser extent. \n \n47.5 “A bhakta, whose main strength is following bhãgvat-dharma, \nlovingly engages himself in performing the basic sevã of Bhagvãn and \nHis bhaktas.  He also abides by the rules, like ahinsã and brahm-\nchãrya, which are related to the dharma of his varna and ãshram.  \nThe bhakta also enjoys building mandirs for Bhagvãn, and working in \nHis gardens.  He enjoys offering different varieties of food to \nBhagvãn, and also enjoys hand-plastering and sweeping the mandirs \nof Bhagvãn and the residential halls of sãdhus.  In addition, he offers \nbhakti to Bhagvãn by listening to kathãs and singing kirtans without \nany form of pretence.  Moreover, such a bhakta who is strong in \nfollowing dharma intensely enjoys listening to and reading shãstras \ndescribing bhãgvat-dharma. \n \n47.6 “A bhakta, whose main strength is ãtmã-nishthã, always behaves as \nthe ãtmã, which is beyond the three bodies and the three mental \nstates, and is described as eternal.  He understands that his ishta-dev, \npratyaksha Shree Krishna Paramãtmã, is beyond everything, has an \nextremely pure svarup, and forever possesses a divya murti.  In \naddition, he talks about and listens to talks describing the pure \nnature of his own ãtmã, as well as talks about Paramãtmã.  He also \nenjoys shãstras that contain such talks.  His nature is such that he is \nunable to tolerate anything that obstructs him from behaving as an \nãtmã. \n \n47.7 “A bhakta, whose main strength is vairãgya-nishthã, has a persistent \ndislike for all worldly objects, but not towards Bhagvãn’s murti.  \nRealising those objects to be asatya, he never remembers his home, \nhis family, or any other object that he has given up – in the same way \nGADHADÃ I \n- 122 - \nthat he never remembers faeces once they have been excreted.  Such \na bhakta only keeps the company of bhaktas who are tyãgis.  In \naddition, he offers bhakti to Bhagvãn in a way that does not conflict \nwith his tyãg.  His talks are always about tyãg, and he has a liking for \nshãstras that propose tyãg.  Moreover, he has an extreme dislike for \ntasty foods, beautiful clothes, and for all worldly objects related to \nthe five vishays that may interfere with his tyãg. \n \n47.8 “A bhakta, whose main strength is bhakti-nishthã, has intense love \nonly for Bhagvãn’s svarup.  Apart from that svarup of Bhagvãn, he is \nunable to focus his mind’s vrutti towards worldly objects.  Yet, he \nlovingly offers rich clothes and jewellery to Bhagvãn.  He also enjoys \nlistening to the human-like charitras of Bhagvãn and also greatly \nenjoys listening to any shãstra that describes Bhagvãn’s svarup.  In \naddition, he only develops love towards those bhaktas who have love \nfor Bhagvãn.  Besides them, he never develops love towards even his \nown son or relatives.  Such a bhakta is always engaged in some \nactivity that is related to Bhagvãn. \n \n47.9 “Now, after reflecting upon this talk, which describes the \ncharacteristics of bhaktas possessing these four strengths, all of you \nplease reveal which of these is your strength.  In actual fact, this talk \nis rather like a mirror, as it reveals a person’s own true strength as it \nis.  Furthermore, those who are Bhagvãn’s bhaktas are never without \na strength.  However, as they may have not recognised it, they find \nthat they cannot intensify it.  As long as it is not strengthened, it will \ncontinue to fluctuate according to the talks a person hears.  So, after \nthinking over this talk, please reveal your strengths as they are.” \n \n47.10 All the haribhaktas then revealed their respective strengths. \n \n47.11 Shreeji Mahãrãj then requested, “Those who have similar strengths, \nplease stand up together.”  Then, those bhaktas with similar \nstrengths, stood up in turn, after which Shreeji Mahãrãj asked all of \nthem to sit down again. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 123 - \n47.12 Nityãnand Swãmi then asked, “Do those four types of bhaktas, with \ntheir strengths, have any gun or avgun in their strengths?” \n \n47.13 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Yes, they do have gun and avgun.  Please \nlisten as I describe them.  The extent to which bhaktas with those \nfour strengths behave according to the characteristics I have \ndescribed earlier, is their gun.  The extent to which they cannot \nbehave according to those characteristics, is their avgun.” \n \n47.14 Finally, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Of the four types of bhaktas, is one \nsuperior to the others, or are they all equal?” \n \n47.15 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “As long as each one adheres to his strength, \nthen all four are equal.  However, if a person adheres to all four \nstrengths, then he is superior to all.  When one person is strong in all \nfour, he is known as param-bhãgvat, and only he can be called an \nekãntik bhakta.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 47 || 47 ||",

    "content": "Protection Against The Four Types Of Kusangis \n \n48.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Mahã sud 13 [27th \nJanuary, 1820], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting facing \nwest on a decorated bedstead on the platform under the neem tree in \nfront of the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A \nsabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him.  Two oil-lamps were lit in front of Him after the \nsandhyã ãrti of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan, and the Nãrãyan dhun had \nfinished. \n \n48.2 After that, Mahãrãj said “Everyone listen very carefully.  I wish to \nspeak to you.”  \nGADHADÃ I \n- 124 - \n48.3 Then, the munis and haribhaktas said, “Mahãrãj, please tell us.” \n \n48.4 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “It is my wish, that all haribhaktas receive \na murti of Nar-Nãrãyan Dev printed on paper, for you to perform \npujã.  This pujã is accepted by all shãstras.  The Shreemad Bhãgvat \nstates that there are eight types of murtis, including a printed murti.  \nTherefore, pujã can be performed upon a printed murti.  This is my \nwish. \n \n \n \n48.5 “In the morning, all haribhaktas should bathe and then perform pujã \nof Nar-Nãrãyan.  Then, you should do pradakshinã and sashtãng \npranãm.  Then, you should ask, ‘Please protect me from the influence \nof kusangis’.” \n \n48.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj then elaborated, “There are four types of kusangis: \nthe kudã-panthis, the shakti-panthis, the shushka-vedãntis, and the \nnãstiks.  If a person associates with kudã-panthis, they will cause him \nto falter in his vartmãns and make him impure.  If a person associates \nwith shakti-panthis, he will be forced to consume meat and alcohol, \nwhich will deflect him from following his svadharma.  If a person \nassociates with a shushka-vedãnti, a person will fall from bhakti and \nupãsanã, because such people claim that the dhãm of Bhagvãn and \nthe murti Bhagvãn are all false.  Finally, if a person associates with \nnãstiks, they promote that only karmas are real, and deny the \nexistence of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, and therefore leads a person \nastray from the path prescribed by the eternal, sacred shãstra. \n \n48.7 “Therefore, a person should request from Bhagvãn, ‘May I never \nencounter the company of these four types of people’.  He should also \npray, ‘Mahãrãj.  Please protect me from the inner enemies of kãm, \nkrodh, lobh, moh, ahankãr, irshyã, and the belief that I am the body.  \nAlso, forever keep me in the company of your bhaktas’.  A person \nshould daily pray to Bhagvãn in this way, and always be wary of such \nkusangis and inner enemies. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 125 - \n48.8 “All haribhaktas should not think, ‘How can the picture on the paper \nprotect us from kusang?’  A person should never bring this thought \ninto the mind.  If all of you listen to me and perform the pujã of Nar-\nNãrãyan, I can communicate with Nar-Nãrãyan, as I am a sat-purush.  \nI will say to Nar-Nãrãyan, ‘Mahãrãj.  Please remain in the murti that I \nhave given, if the haribhaktas abide by the panch-vartmãn, and \nperform pujã of the murti’. \n \n48.9 “I will keep Nar-Nãrãyan Dev by force in the murti, and tie him with a \nrope in the form of love.  So, please keep faith that the murti on paper \nis truly Nar-Nãrãyan Dev.  Knowing this, never leave a murti without \nhaving performed pujã.  In the morning, after bathing, you should \nperform pujã of Bhagvãn.  Then, you should attend to your daily \nduties.  As long as you follow the panch-vartmãn, and perform pujã of \nNar-Nãrãyan Dev, He will remain in this murti.  This is my ãgnã, \nwhich you all should believe with firm faith.” \n \n48.10 The haribhaktas accepted everything that was said by Shreeji \nMahãrãj. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 48 || 48 ||",

    "content": "Antar-Drashti \n \n49.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Mahã sud 14 [28th \nJanuary, 1820], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a \ndecorated bedstead on the platform under the neem tree in front of \nthe mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  Two small oil lamps were lit in front of Him.  He was \nwearing a garland of yellow flowers around His neck, and strings of \nyellow flowers decorated both wrists.  He was dressed entirely in \nwhite clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 126 - \n \n49.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Please begin a question-answer \ndiscussion.” \n \n49.3 Then, Brahmãnand Swãmi asked, “Why is it that our vrutti remains \non Bhagvãn only as long as we forcibly keep it there, whereas it \nremains on worldly objects without the slightest effort?” \n \n49.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The vrutti of Bhagvãn’s bhakta never \nremains on anything except Bhagvãn.  In fact, his only concern is ‘It \nwill be very difficult for me to keep my vrutti on worldly objects’.  \nTherefore, Bhagvãn’s bhakta finds it difficult to keep his vrutti on any \nworldly objects, while a worldly person finds it difficult to keep his \nvrutti on Bhagvãn.  A person whose vrutti does not remain fixed on \nBhagvãn, is not a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  Nevertheless, if he attends \nsatsang, he will gradually become a bhakta by listening to the talks of \nthe sãdhus.” \n \n49.5 Brahmãnand Swãmi then asked further, “By what means can a \nperson keep his vrutti on Bhagvãn?” \n \n49.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The way to achieve that is antar-drashti.  \nAntar-drashti is to constantly look towards the murti of pratyaksha \nBhagvãn that a person has attained.  Besides that murti, even if he \nsees the six chakras, or Golok, or Vaikunth, or other dhãms of \nBhagvãn, it should not be considered to be antar-drashti.  Therefore, \nto look at Bhagvãn’s murti that a person has seen within his heart, or \nto look at the murti of Bhagvãn visible externally, is known as antar-\ndrashti.  However, wherever a person’s vrutti strays apart from \nBhagvãn’s murti, it is called bãhya-drashti.”  \n \n49.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj then told the paramhans, “Please arrange yourselves \ninto pairs, and begin a question-answer discussion.” \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 127 - \n49.8 Then, the paramhans carried out a question-answer discussion \namongst themselves for quite some time, through which Shreeji \nMahãrãj examined their intelligence. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 49 || 49 ||",

    "content": "A Person With A Sharp Intellect \n \n50.1 In the Samvat year 1876, in the early hours of Mahã vad 1 [31st \nJanuary, 1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in front of the veranda \noutside Dãdã Khãchar’s medi in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in \nwhite clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \n \n50.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then asked the munis, “A person who possesses a \nsharp intellect attains Brahm.  Can the intellect of a person who is \nskilled in the managing of worldly affairs be called sharp, or not?  \nAlso, can the intellect of a person who is very skilled in interpreting \nthe shãstras and the Purãns be called sharp, or not?” \n \n50.3 The munis attempted to answer the question, but were unable to do \nso adequately. \n \n50.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “Some people may be extremely \nskilled in worldly affairs, yet they do nothing at all to safeguard their \nown kalyãn.  Others know the precise meanings of the various \nshãstras, Purãns, and other historical shãstras, yet they too do \nnothing to safeguard their kalyãn.  Therefore, they cannot be said to \npossess a sharp intellect.  Instead, they possess a blunt intellect.  On \nthe other hand, a person who safeguards his kalyãn, even though he \nmay possess only a limited intellect, should be considered to have a \nsharp intellect.  So, a person who pays more attention to worldly \naffairs, even though he possesses a sharp intellect, should be \nconsidered to possess a blunt intellect. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 128 - \n50.5 “This is stated in the Bhagvad Geetã:  \n \nyã nishã sarva-bhootãnãm tasyãm jãgrati sayami \nyasyãm jãgrati bhutãni sã nishã pashyato munehe \n \n“This shlok explains that while worshipping Bhagvãn, all worldly \npeople behave as if their mind is covered in darkness, like the night.  \nTherefore, they do not worship Bhagvãn.  On the other hand, \nBhagvãn’s bhaktas are awake in worshipping Bhagvãn.  Therefore, \nthey are constantly engaged in worshipping Bhagvãn.  Furthermore, \neveryone’s mind is awake with respect to the five vishays – shabda, \nsparsh, rup, ras, and gandh – and they continuously indulge in the \nvishays.  In contrast, the minds of the Bhagvãn’s bhaktas, are covered \nin darkness with regards to indulging in the vishays.  Therefore, they \ndo not indulge in them. \n \n50.6 “Therefore, only a person who remains alert regarding his own \nkalyãn can be said to possess a sharp intellect.  As for others, they are \nall mere fools.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 50 || 50 ||",

    "content": "Nishchay In Bhagvãn Can Only Be Developed Through Bhagvãn \n \n51.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the night of Mahã vad 2 [1st February, \n1820], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms in front of \nthe mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He was wearing a white survãl and a white angarkhu.  He \nhad also tied a white pãgh around His head.  A sabhã of munis, as well \nas haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n51.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please ask a question.” \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 129 - \n51.3 Purnãnand Swãmi then asked, “The ten indriyas are produced from \nrajo-gun, and the four antah-karans are produced from sattva-gun.  \nTherefore, all the indriyas and antah-karans are mãyik.  However, \nBhagvãn is beyond Mãyã.  So, how can a person develop nishchay in \nBhagvãn through the mãyik antah-karans?  Also, how can a person \nsee Bhagvãn with his mãyik indriyas, like the eyes?” \n \n51.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Mãyik objects can be realised by mãyik \nmeans, and if a person has realised Bhagvãn through the same mãyik \nantah-karans and indriyas, then it implies that Bhagvãn must also be \nmãyik.  Is that your question, or not?” \n \n51.5 Purnãnand Swãmi and all the munis confirmed, “Yes Mahãrãj.  That is \nour question.  You have clarified it for us.” \n \n51.6 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The answer to that is as follows:  \nThe surface area of the pruthvi is 500,000,000 yojans.  On the pruthvi, \nthere are various objects such as trees, mountains, pots, and clothes.  \nThat pruthvi exists within all of those objects, and it also exists \ndistinctly on its own.  So, if a person looks from the perspective of \npruthvi, then it appears that pruthvi has taken the form of all of those \nobjects, and that no object exists apart from pruthvi.  However, \npruthvi itself has been produced from a small portion of jal.  This jal \nis below the pruthvi, around it, as well as above it.  In fact, jal totally \npervades the pruthvi.  If a person looks from the perspective of jal, \nonly jal exists, and there is no pruthvi at all.  Furthermore, that jal has \nbeen produced from a small portion of tej.  If a person looks from the \nperspective of tej, only tej exists, and there is no jal at all.  This tej, has \nbeen produced from a small portion of vãyu.  If a person looks from \nthe perspective of vãyu, only vãyu exists, and there is no tej at all.  \nThis vãyu has been produced from a small portion of ãkãsh.  If a \nperson looks from the perspective of ãkãsh, the other four bhuts, the \nentities evolved from them (the body and the brahmãnd) are not \napparent at all.  It appears as if only ãkãsh exists everywhere.  \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 130 - \n51.7 “This ãkãsh has been produced from a small portion of tãmas-\nahankãr.  That tãmas-ahankãr, along with rãjas-ahankãr, sãttvik-\nahankãr, the bhuts, the indriyas, and antah-karans, and their \npresiding devs, have been produced from a small portion of maha-\ntattva.  So, if a person looks from the perspective of maha-tattva, the \nthree types of ahankãrs, the bhuts, the indriyas, the antah-karans, and \ntheir presiding devs, do not exist – only maha-tattva exists.  So, if a \nperson looks from the perspective of maha-tattva, the three types of \nahankãrs, the bhuts, the indriyas, the antah-karans, and their \npresiding devs, do not exist – only maha-tattva exists.  That maha-\ntattva has been produced from a small portion of Pradhãn-Prakruti.  \nTherefore, if a person looks from the perspective of Prakruti, maha-\ntattva does not exist – only Prakruti exists.  However, during the \nperiod of destruction, Prakruti is absorbed into a small portion of \nPurush, and at the time of creation, she is produced again from a \nsmall portion of Purush.  Therefore, if a person looks from the \nperspective of Purush, only Purush exists – there is no Prakruti. \n \n51.8 “Countless millions of Purush are produced from a small portion of \nMahã-Mãyã.  So, if a person looks from the perspective of Mahã-\nMãyã, only Mahã-Mãyã exists – there is no Purush.  Mahã-Mãyã itself \nis produced from a small portion of Mahã-Purush.  So, if a person \nlooks from the perspective of Mahã-Purush, only Mahã-Purush exists \n– there is no Mahã-Mãyã.  That Mahã-Purush, rose from a small \nregion of Akshar – the dhãm of Purushottam Bhagvãn.  Therefore, if a \nperson looks from the perspective of Akshar, neither Mahã-Purush \nnor anything else exists – there is only Akshar.  But, above that \nAkshar is Purushottam Bhagvãn, who is even greater than Akshar.  \nThat Purushottam Bhagvãn is that all-doer – responsible for the \ncreation, sustenance, and destruction of everything – and is also the \ncause of all. \n \n51.9 “Now, a cause always pervades its effect, and at the same time, also \nremains distinct from it.  Therefore, if a person looks from the \nGADHADÃ I \n- 131 - \nperspective of Purushottam Bhagvãn, the cause of all, then nothing \nelse appears to exist – except Purushottam Bhagvãn.   \n \n51.10 “It is this very Bhagvãn who, out of compassion for the kalyãn of the \njeevs, gives darshan in a pratyaksha svarup to all the people on this \nearth.  At that time, if a person realises this greatness of Purushottam \nBhagvãn by intense association with a sant, then all of his indriyas \nand antah-karans become divya, just like Purushottam Bhagvãn’s \nindriyas and antah-karans.  Then, through those indriyas and antah-\nkarans, he can develop nishchay in Bhagvãn.  For example, a diamond \ncan only be cut by another diamond; it can never be cut by anything \nelse.  Similarly, the nishchay in Bhagvãn can only be developed \nthrough Bhagvãn.  In the same way, the darshan of Bhagvãn is also \npossible only through Bhagvãn, but it is not possible through the \nmãyik indriyas and antah-karans.” \n \n51.11 Having delivered this talk, Shreeji Mahãrãj bid “Jay Sachidãnand” to \nall and returned to His residence. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 51 || 51 ||",

    "content": "Realising Bhagvãn Through The Four Shãstras \n \n52.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Mahã vad 3 [2nd February, 1820], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was having kathã read on the veranda outside Dãdã \nKhãchar’s medi in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  \nA sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \n52.2 During the kathã, a reference was made to the fact that a person who \nunderstands Bhagvãn’s svarup through the four sets of shãstras – \nSãnkhya, Yog, Vedãnt, and Panch-Rãtra – should be known to be \ncompletely enlightened. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 132 - \n52.3 Hearing this, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, please explain how \na person can realise Bhagvãn through those four sets of shãstras?  \nAlso, what deficiency remains in a person who does not realise \nBhagvãn in that way?” \n \n52.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The Sãnkhya shãstras propose Bhagvãn as \nbeing the twenty-fifth tattva.  Also, just as the twenty-four tattvas are \nincapable of doing anything without Bhagvãn, jeev and ishvar are also \nincapable of doing anything without Bhagvãn.  Therefore, jeev and \nishvar are also included in the twenty-four tattvas.  These twenty-\nfour tattvas, which include jeev and ishvar, are called kshetra.  \nBhagvãn, the twenty-fifth tattva, is called kshetragna. \n \n52.5 “The Yog shãstras propose Bhagvãn as being the twenty-sixth tattva, \nand as possessing a definite murti.  They describe jeev and ishvar as \nthe twenty-fifth tattva, and describe the twenty-four tattvas as being \ndistinct from them.  They prescribe that a person should perform \ndhyãn upon Bhagvãn, realising his ãtmã to be distinct from those \ntattvas. \n \n52.6 “The Vedãnt shãstras describe Bhagvãn as pervading all, as being the \ncause of all, as the supporter of all, as nirgun, advait, and niranjan,  \nand as the non-doer despite being the all-doer.  They also describe \nHim as possessing only divya qualities and not any worldly qualities. \n \n52.7 “The Panch-Rãtra shãstras describe that there is only one Bhagvãn, \nwho is Shree Krishna Purushottam Nãrãyan.  He incarnates into the \nfour svarups of Vãsudev, Sankarshan, Aniruddha, and Pradyumna.  It is \nalso He who assumes an avatãr on this earth.  A person who offers \nthe nine types of bhakti to Him, attains kalyãn. \n \n52.8 “These are the various descriptions of Bhagvãn as given in those four \nscriptures.  A person who thoroughly understands them, should be \nknown to be completely enlightened. \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 133 - \n52.9 “However, a discrepancy would arise if a person were to try to \nunderstand Bhagvãn’s svarup using only the Sãnkhya shãstras, while \nleaving the other three shãstras aside.  The Sãnkhya shãstras do not \ndescribe jeev and ishvar as being distinct from the twenty-four \ntattvas.  Therefore, when the followers of Sãnkhya reject the twenty-\nfour tattvas and believe their jeevãtmã to be distinct from them, they \nwould understand their jeevãtmã as the twenty-fifth tattva, but not \nBhagvãn. \n \n52.10 “There is a weakness in trying to understand Bhagvãn’s svarup from \nthe Yog shãstras alone.  They believe that Bhagvãn possesses a \ndefinite murti, but the followers of Yog consider Him to have \nlimitations.  They do not understand Him to be the antaryãmi of all, \nand absolutely perfect. \n \n52.11 “There is also a weakness in trying to understand Bhagvãn’s svarup \nfrom the Vedãnt shãstra alone.  They believe that Bhagvãn – who is \nthe cause of all, pervades all, and is nirgun – is nirãkãr.  They do not \nrealise that Bhagvãn’s eternal svarup possesses divya limbs, not \nmãyik arms and legs. \n \n52.12 “There is also a weakness in trying to understand Bhagvãn’s svarup \nfrom the Panch-Rãtra shãstras alone.  They offer bhakti to Bhagvãn, \nbut they see Bhagvãn’s avatãrs with human traits.  Also, they \nunderstand Bhagvãn to be present in only one place at any one time, \nand not as being the antaryãmi of all and absolutely perfect. \n \n52.13 “These are the types of weaknesses that arise when a person does \nnot realise Bhagvãn using a combination of all four sets of shãstras.  \nHowever, if a person attempts to realise Bhagvãn using all four sets \nof shãstras together, then the weakness raised from the \nunderstanding of one set of shãstras, is corrected by the \nunderstanding of another.  Therefore, a person who understands \nBhagvãn using all four sets of shãstras, is known as being completely \nenlightened. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 134 - \n52.14 “If he ignores one set of shãstras, he is known as being three-quarters \nenlightened.  If he ignores two sets of shãstras, he is known as being \nhalf-enlightened.  If ignores three sets of scriptures, he is known as \nbeing a quarter enlightened.  If he acts according to his own fictional \ninterpretations of the shãstras while ignoring all four sets of shãstras, \nthen even if he is a vedãnti or a person with upãsanã, he is lost.  He \ncannot be said to have found the path of kalyãn.  Therefore, such a \nvedãnti’s gnãn is hypocritical, and a person with such upãsanã is a \nhypocritical bhakta.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 52 || 52 ||",

    "content": "Progression And Regression In Satsang \n \n53.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Mahã vad 9 [8th February, 1820], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was sitting facing west on a decorated bedstead on the \nveranda outside the west-facing rooms in front of the mandir of Shree \nVãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was \nwearing a white survãl and a white angarkhu.  He had tied a rich, \norange shelu with a silken border around His waist.  He had also tied \na rich, orange reto with a silken border around His head, with tassels \nof flowers hanging from it.  He was also wearing garlands of flowers \naround His neck.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n53.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then requested, “Someone please ask a question.” \n \n53.3 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “There are those in satsang who \nprogress day by day.  There are also those who seem to fall back day \nby day, despite being in satsang.  What is the reason for this?” \n \n53.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “A person who perceives avgun in a great \nsãdhu, gradually falls back in satsang.  Conversely, a person who \nGADHADÃ I \n- 135 - \nperceives gun in that sãdhu progresses, and his bhakti towards \nBhagvãn flourishes.  Therefore, a person should not perceive avgun \nin a sãdhu.  Instead, should only perceive his gun. \n \n53.5 “A person should perceive an avgun in that sãdhu only if he breaks \nany of the vartmãns prescribed by Bhagvãn.  However, even if the \nsãdhu has no flaws in following his vartmãns, on seeing some small \nirregularity in the sãdhu’s nature, a person may feel that is improper.  \nTherefore, they focus only on the sãdhu’s avgun, and ignore his many \ngun.  This causes the person’s own glorious gun, like of gnãn and \nvairãgya, to diminish.  \n \n53.6 “Therefore, only if there is a flaw in the following of the vartmãns, \nshould a person find avgun; he should not find avgun in a bhakta of \nBhagvãn for any other reason. \n \n53.7 “Moreover, if a person does not find flaws, his glorious gun will begin \nto flourish day by day.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 53 || 53 ||",

    "content": "Upholding Bhãgvat-Dharma \nThe Gateway To Moksh \n \n54.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Mahã vad 11 [9th February, 1820], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \nlarge, cylindrical pillow on the veranda outside the west-facing \nrooms in front of the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes and had \ncovered Himself with an orange reto that had a border of interlocked \ngolden and silver threads.  He had also tied a feto around His head \nGADHADÃ I \n- 136 - \nusing a sky-blue silken cloth.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n54.2 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “Through the discussion between \nJanak Rãjã and the nine Yogeshvars, the eleventh skandh of the \nShreemad Bhãgvat describes the nature of a bhãgvat-dharma.  How is \nthe bhãgvat-dharma sustained?  Also, how can the gateway to moksh \nbe opened for the jeev?” \n \n54.3 Shreeji \nMahãrãj \nreplied, \n“Bhãgvat-dharma \nis \nsustained \nby \nmaintaining intense love towards an ekãntik sãdhu of Bhagvãn, who \npossesses the qualities of svadharma, gnãn, vairãgya, and bhakti \ncoupled with knowledge of Bhagvãn’s greatness.  Maintaining intense \nlove towards such a sãdhu also opens the gateway to moksh for the \njeev.  Kapil-Dev Bhagvãn has said to Devhuti: \n \nprasanga-majaram pãsha-mãtmanaha kavayo viduhu \nsa eva sãdhushu kruto moksha-dvãrama-pavrutam \n \n“This means: ‘If a person maintains intense love towards an ekãntik \nsant of Bhagvãn just as strongly as he maintains intense love towards \nhis own relatives, then the gateway to moksh is open for him’.” \n \n54.4 Shuk Muni then asked, “By what characteristic can someone \nrecognise a person who would never lapse in following his dharma, \neven under the most difficult circumstances?” \n \n54.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person whose nature is such that he is \nstrict in obeying the ãgnã of Bhagvãn, and who would never disobey \nany ãgnã, however minor or major, will never fall back from \nfollowing dharma, irrespective of the circumstances.  Therefore, \ndetermination in dharma is found only in those who strictly follow \nBhagvãn’s ãgnã, and their satsang also remains strong.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 54 || 54 || \nGADHADÃ I \n- 137 -",

    "content": "Bhajan, Smaran, Vartmãn \n \n55.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Mahã vad 11 [10th February, 1820], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on the east-facing veranda of His own \nresidence in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of sants, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n55.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please begin a question-answer \ndiscussion.” \n \n55.3 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “Why is a person unable to remain \ndetermined in bhajan, smaran, and the vartmãns?” \n \n55.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “A person’s determination does not \nremain steady due to the influence of unpleasant desh, kãl, kriyã, and \nsang.  There are three levels of this determination: uttam, madhyam, \nand kanishth.  If there are extremely unpleasant desh, kãl, kriyã, and \nsang, then even the uttam level determination is dissolved.  Then, \nwhat can be said of the madhyam and kanishth levels of \ndetermination? \n \n55.5 “However, if a person’s determination remains exactly the same, \ndespite the influence of extremely unpleasant desh, kãl, kriyã, and \nsang, then the force of good deeds and merits previously performed \nby him must be extremely powerful.  On the other hand, a person’s \nintellect may become polluted despite extremely pleasant desh, kãl, \nkriyã, and sang.  This is because he must have committed a great sin, \nor must have insulted a great bhakta of Bhagvãn, either in a past life \nor in this life.  Therefore, despite association with pleasant desh, kãl, \nkriyã, and sang, his mind has still become polluted. \n \n55.6 “If a person serves a great sant attentively, his sins will be burnt and \nreduced to ashes.  On the other hand, if a person associates with a \nGADHADÃ I \n- 138 - \ngreat sinner, then his own sins increase, and any religious deeds that \nhe may have performed, will also be destroyed.  Also, a person who \nputs his arms around the necks of prostitutes drinking alcohol, and \nthen blames Bhagvãn by thinking, ‘Why did Bhagvãn not keep my \nmind stable?’ should be known as an utter fool.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 55 || 55 ||",

    "title": "A Bhakta With Gnãn",
    "content": "A Bhakta With Gnãn \nKnowledge Of The Ãtmã \nUpãsanã \n \n56.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Mahã vad 12 [11th \nFebruary, 1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead \non the veranda outside the west-facing rooms in front of the mandir \nof Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas wearing a white khes, and had covered Himself with an orange \nreto, interlaced with gold and silver threads.  He had also tied a reto, \nwith a deep orange border, around His head.  A sabhã of munis, as \nwell as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.  \nAfter singing the ‘Nãrãyan’ dhun, some munis were singing kirtans to \nthe accompaniment of a jhãnjh and mrudang.   \n \n56.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Please conclude singing kirtans, and let us \nconduct a question-answer discussion for a while.”  Having said this, \nShreeji Mahãrãj said, “Let me ask a question.” \n \n56.3 He then began by saying, “Shree Krishna Bhagvãn mentions four \ntypes of bhaktas in the Geetã.  Of these, the bhaktas with gnãn are \ndescribed as being the best.  However, if all four have an equal level \nof nishchay in Bhagvãn’s svarup, how is the bhakta with gnãn \nsuperior?” \nGADHADÃ I \n- 139 - \n56.4 The munis attempted to answer that question, but were unable to \ngive a satisfactory answer. \n \n56.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “The bhakta possessing gnãn \nbehaves as brahm-svarup and thoroughly realises the greatness of \nBhagvãn.  As a result, no desires remain in his mind except for those \nof Bhagvãn’s svarup.  However, the other three types of bhaktas do \nnot fully realise the greatness of Bhagvãn, despite having nishchay in \nBhagvãn.  This means that desires, other than those for Bhagvãn, still \ncontinue.  That is why they do not come equal to those bhaktas \npossessing gnãn.  Therefore, if any desires, other than those related \nto Bhagvãn, remain in a bhakta, it is a serious flaw. \n \n56.6 “Another major flaw is when a person who has no worldly desires at \nall and has intense vairãgya, behaves arrogantly on account of that \nvairãgya.  Also, he may have the intense force of knowledge of the \nãtmã, or may have the force of intense bhakti towards Bhagvãn.  \nHowever, if out of arrogance, he is unable to bow before humble \nbhaktas or is unable to address them humbly, then that is also a \nserious flaw in him.  As a result of that flaw, his strength in satsang \ndoes not flourish.   \n \n \n56.7 “Consider the analogy of a stone-cutter digging a well.  If the stone \nunderneath sounds hollow when he strikes it, he predicts, ‘There will \nbe plenty of water in this water-well’.  However, if the stone sounds \nsolid on the surface, and sparks fly when he strikes it, then the stone-\ncutter assumes, ‘If there is going to be any water in this water-well at \nall, there will be very little’.  In the same way, a person who remains \narrogant due to the pride of his gnãn, vairãgya, and bhakti, may be \ncalled great, but his greatness will be very limited, as he does not \nperceive the gun of humble bhaktas.  Therefore, whoever wishes to \nplease Bhagvãn should not become arrogant due to the pride of his \ngnãn, vairãgya, and bhakti, or due to any other glorious gun he may \nhave.  As a result, pratyaksha Shree Krishna Nãrãyan will become \npleased, and will reside in his heart.” \nGADHADÃ I \n- 140 - \n56.8 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “Mahãrãj, by which method can a \nperson overcome the pride which arises due to gnãn, vairãgya, \nbhakti, and other glorious gun?” \n \n \n \n56.9 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “While realising the greatness of Bhagvãn’s \nbhaktas, if he physically bows down to them, serves them, recognises \nthoughts of pride when they arise in his heart, and maintains the \nforce of thought, then pride is eradicated.” \n \n56.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj then continued, “A bhakta’s great, loving bhakti for \nBhagvãn may be so intense, that Bhagvãn does as that bhakta wishes.  \nHowever, if that bhakta develops pride in his heart due to that bhakti, \nit presents a serious flaw on his part.  Also, a bhakta may be arrogant \ndue to his knowledge of the ãtmã or due to his vairãgya, but that \narrogance only serves to strengthen his belief of being the body.  \nTherefore, bhaktas of Bhagvãn should not hold on to any form of \npride whatsoever.  That is the only means to please Bhagvãn. \n \n56.11 “Furthermore,  if great bhaktas of Bhagvãn examine themselves and \nlook inwards towards their own hearts when even a little pride \narises, they would notice an expression of disgust on the murti of \nBhagvãn residing within their hearts.  Conversely, when they behave \nhumbly, Bhagvãn’s murti residing within their hearts would appear \nto have an extremely pleased expression.  Therefore, using the force \nof thought, a bhakta of Bhagvãn should not allow any sort of pride to \narise. \n \n56.12 “However, if pride does exist with gnãn, vairãgya, and bhakti, it is \nrather like impurities added to gold.  If impurities are added to \ntwenty-four carat gold, it becomes twenty-two carat.  Adding more \nimpurities renders it eighteen-carat.  Adding even more impurities \nrenders it twelve-carat gold.  In the same way, as impurities (pride) \nmix with that bhakta’s gnãn, vairãgya, and bhakti, the purity of all \nthree gradually decreases.  Therefore, gnãn, vairãgya, and bhakti \nwithout pride, are like twenty-four carat gold. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 141 - \n56.13 “If a person is arrogant, the qualities of gnãn, vairãgya, and bhakti \nmay make him appear virtuous from the surface, but he does not \nhave any inner-strength.  For example, this pruthvi, with a surface \narea of 500,000,000 yojans, supports the oceans, the mountains, and \nall forms of life, and so it appears very strong.  However, because the \npruthvi floats on jal like a dung-cake, jal appears to be much stronger \nthan pruthvi.  Likewise, tej appears to be much stronger than jal, and \nvãyu appears to be even stronger than tej.  Finally, although it \nappears to have no strength at all, ãkãsh is the strongest of them all \nsince it supports all the other four.  Similarly, the qualities of gnãn, \nvairãgya, and bhakti of a bhakta who has no pride, are as powerful as \nãkãsh.  He may not outwardly appear to be powerful, but such a \nhumble bhakta is superior to all. \n \n56.14 “Moreover, just as a child never has any feelings of pride, in the same \nway, no matter how much praise or respect he encounters, a sãdhu \nshould always behave without pride – just like a child.” \n \n56.15 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked another question:  “The jeev is distinct \nfrom the indriyas, antah-karans, and prãns.  It is also distinct from the \nthree mental states of jãgrat, svapna, and sushupti, and the three \nbodies of sthul, sukshma, and kãran.  After hearing this in satsang, a \nfirm belief of this has been developed.  So why does the blissful \njeevãtmã, while engaged in the bhajan and smaran of Paramãtmã, \nstill associate with the indriyas, antah-karans, prãns, the three mental \nstates, and the three bodies, causing it to become miserable due to \nthe influence of disturbing thoughts?” \n \n56.16 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Many people become siddh, many become \nsarvagna, and many become devs.  Therefore, they attain countless \ntypes of greatness, including Akshardhãm.  All this is achieved \nthrough the force of the upãsanã of Bhagvãn, and without upãsanã \nnothing can be accomplished.  Therefore, the distinction between \nãtmã and non-ãtmã cannot be realised by merely understanding the \ndistinction as given in the shãstras, nor can it be realised by listening \nGADHADÃ I \n- 142 - \nto talks from senior sãdhus and deciding in the mind,  ‘I shall now \ndistinguish between ãtmã and non-ãtmã’.  Instead, it is the extent of a \nperson’s nishchay in his ishta-dev that determines how much \ndistinction he develops between ãtmã and non-ãtmã.  In fact, without \nusing the strength of his ishta-dev, no spiritual activities can be \nfulfilled. \n \n56.17 “In contrast, a person who has loving bhakti for Bhagvãn, like the \ngopis, has completed all spiritual activities.  However, if a person \ndoes not have such love, then he should understand the greatness of \nBhagvãn in the following way: ‘Bhagvãn is the master of Golok, \nVaikunth, Shvet-Dvip, and Brahm-Mahol.  Although He appears to be \nlike a human for the purpose of granting happiness to His bhaktas, His \nmurti in His dhãms like Golok and Vaikunth, radiates with the \nbrilliance of millions and millions of suns from each part of His body.  \nHowever, in Mrutyu-Lok, humans serve Him, and He becomes visible \nonly when a small oil lamp is lit in front of Him.  Nonetheless, it is He \nwho provides light to those like the sun and the moon.  That Bhagvãn is \nsuch that Radhikã, Lakshmi, and His other bhaktas constantly serve \nHim in His dhãms.  Following the destruction of the brahmãnds, it is \nonly this pratyaksha Bhagvãn who remains.  Also, it is this same \nBhagvãn who, at the time of creation, creates countless millions of \nbrahmãnds through Prakruti and Purush’. \n \n56.18 “Thinking of Bhagvãn’s greatness in this way, is the only method for \nunderstanding the distinctions between ãtmã and non-ãtmã.  In \naddition, the extent of that bhakta’s nishchay in Bhagvãn, coupled \nwith the knowledge of Bhagvãn’s greatness, also determines the \namount of vairãgya that develops in that bhakta’s heart.  Therefore, \nafter abandoning the dependence on the strength of other spiritual \nactivities, a person should rely exclusively on the strength of \nBhagvãn’s upãsanã.   \n \n56.19 “Such a bhakta believes, ‘However great a sinner a person may be, if at \nthe end of his life, he utters ‘Swãminãrãyan’, he will be redeemed of all \nGADHADÃ I \n- 143 - \nsins and will reside in Brahm-Mahol.  Then, how can there be any doubt \nabout a bhakta, who has taken refuge in that Bhagvãn, attaining the \ndhãm of Bhagvãn?’  That is how he understands the greatness of \nBhagvãn.  Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvãn should increase the \nstrength of their upãsanã of Bhagvãn day by day, by practicing \nsatsang.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 56 || 56 ||",

    "content": "The Most Extraordinary Method To Attain Moksh \n \n57.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fãgan sud 2 [15th February, 1820], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in the residential hall of the sãdhus in \nDãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \n \n57.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Those of you who know how to engage \nin a question-answer discussion, may ask one question each.”  \n \n57.3 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “Mahãrãj, what is the most \nextraordinary means of attaining moksh?” \n \n57.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The knowledge of Bhagvãn’s svarup and the \nknowledge of Bhagvãn’s greatness are the two most extraordinary \nmeans to attain moksh.” \n \n57.5 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked another question, “What is the nature \nof love towards Bhagvãn?” \n \n57.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “The nature of true love is that it should \nnot be developed by logical thinking.  However, if a person develops \nGADHADÃ I \n- 144 - \nlove by logically thinking of Bhagvãn’s gun, then perceiving avgun in \nBhagvãn will cause his love to be broken.  Therefore, it is best to \nleave such love as it was originally, rather than repeatedly \nestablishing it and then raising doubts about it.  Instead, a person \nshould develop love towards Bhagvãn with blind faith.  After all, love \ndeveloped by logically thinking of Bhagvãn’s gun cannot be trusted.  \nTherefore, a person should develop the same type of love towards \nBhagvãn as he has for his bodily relations.  This love is known as love \ndue to blind faith.  However, having said this, love developed by \nrealising Bhagvãn’s greatness is of a totally different nature \naltogether.” \n \n57.7 Shivãnand Swãmi then asked, “Although a person has an intense \nyearning to stay in the satsang, why is it that some inappropriate \nsvabhãvs are still not eradicated?” \n \n57.8 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “If a person has not developed a dislike \nfor the svabhãv that is holding him back in satsang, how can he be \nsaid to have an intense yearning for satsang?  And how can he be said \nto have realised that svabhãv to be his enemy?  For example, if a \nfriend of yours were to kill your brother, your friendship with him \nwould no longer remain.  Instead, you would be prepared to cut off \nhis head.  This is because the relationship with a brother is closer \nthan that with a friend.  Likewise, a person may have a svabhãv that \ncauses him to break his vartmãns and fall from satsang.  Despite this, \nif he still does not have any feeling of hatred towards it and does not \ndevelop bitterness towards it, then he does not have total love for \nsatsang.  On the other hand, if his love for satsang is like the love he \nhas for his brother, then he would shun that negative svabhãv \nimmediately.  After all, the jeev is extremely powerful.  The mind and \nindriyas are all merely the kshetra, whereas the jeev is their \nkshetragna; the jeev can achieve whatever it attempts.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 57 || 57 || \nGADHADÃ I \n- 145 -",

    "content": "The Body, Kusang, And Past Sanskãrs \n \n58.1 In the Samvat year 1876, at the time of the sandhyã ãrti on Fãgan sud \n5 [18th February, 1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in the residential \nhall of the paramhans in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was \ndressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n58.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Please ask a question.” \n \n58.3 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, when a bhakta of Bhagvãn \nengages in bhajan and smaran of Bhagvãn, he is disturbed by the \nforces of rajo-gun and tamo-gun in his heart.  As a result, he is unable \nto experience the bliss of bhajan and smaran.  So, how can a person \novercome the force of rajo-gun and tamo-gun?” \n \n58.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The influence of the gun is due to three \nfactors – the body, kusang, and past sanskãrs.  Of these, the gun that \narise due to the body are overcome by reflecting upon the ãtmã and \nthe non-ãtmã.  Gun that have arisen due to kusang are eradicated by \nkeeping the company of a sãdhu.  Should these two methods fail to \neradicate the force of rajo-gun and tamo-gun, then the problem lies in \nthe influence of some unpleasant sanskãrs of the past; they are very \ndifficult to eradicate.” \n \n58.5 Ãnandãnand Swãmi then asked, “How can such unpleasant sanskãrs \nof the past be eradicated?” \n \n58.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “If an extremely great sant becomes \npleased upon a person, then regardless of how unpleasant the \nperson’s sanskãrs may be, they are all destroyed.  Moreover, if a great \nsant is pleased, a beggar can become a king.  No matter how \nunpleasant a person’s prãrabdha may be, it becomes pleasant.  Also, \nhe avoids any terrible hardships that lie ahead.” \nGADHADÃ I \n- 146 - \n58.7 Ãnandãnand Swãmi asked further, “How can a person please such a \ngreat sant?” \n \n58.8 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “First of all, he must be honest with a \ngreat sant.  He must also abandon kãm, krodh, lobh, moh, mad, \nmatsar, ãshã, trushnã, ahankãr, and irshyã.  Moreover, he should \nbehave as a dãs of a sant, and maintain a constant effort to eradicate \npride from his heart.  While doing so internally, he should physically \ncontinue to bow to everyone as well.  As a result, the great sant will \nbecome pleased with him.” \n \n58.9 Mahãnubhavãnand Swãmi then asked, “Mahãrãj, while staying in \nsatsang, how can a person eradicate all of his faults?  Also, how can a \nperson’s bhakti towards Bhagvãn continue to flourish day by day?” \n \n58.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The more a person continues to perceive \nthe gun of the great sant, the more his bhakti begins to flourish.  If he \nrealises the truly great sant to be completely nishkãmi, then even if he \nhas as much kãm as a dog, he will also become nishkãmi.  Conversely, \nif he perceives the avgun of kãm in the great sant, then no matter how \nnishkãm he may be, he becomes full of intense kãm.  In the same way, \nif a person views the great sant to be full of krodh or lobh, then he will \nalso become full of krodh and lobh.  Therefore, if a person \nunderstands the great sant to be absolutely free of kãm, lobh, svãd, \nmãn, and sneh, he will also become free of all of those evil natures \nand become a faithful bhakta. \n \n58.11 “What are the characteristics of such a faithful bhakta?  Well, just as \nhe has a natural dislike for objects that cause misery, similarly he has \na natural dislike for the attractive five vishays (shabda, sparsh, rup, \nras, and gandh).  Moreover, he has firm nishchay in Bhagvãn alone.  \nSuch a person should be known as a faithful haribhakta. \n58.12 “The only way of becoming such a faithful bhakta, is by behaving as a \ndãs of the dãs of Bhagvãn, and by realising, ‘All these bhaktas are \ngreat, and I am inferior compared to them all’.  Realising this, he \nGADHADÃ I \n- 147 - \nbehaves as a dãs of the bhaktas of Bhagvãn.  All the evil natures of a \nperson who behaves in this way are destroyed; and day by day, \nglorious qualities, such as gnãn, vairãgya, and bhakti, continue to \nflourish within him.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 58 || 58 ||",

    "content": "Unique Love For Bhagvãn \n \n59.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fãgan sud 14 [27th February, 1820], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting facing west on a decorated bedstead on \nthe veranda outside the west-facing rooms in front of the mandir of \nShree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white \nchãdar.  He had also tied a white cloth, with a border of silken thread, \naround His head.  His forehead had been smeared with sandalwood \npaste.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n59.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Please begin a question-answer \ndiscussion.” \n \n59.3 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “Mahãrãj.  How can unique love \ntowards Bhagvãn be developed?” \n \n59.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person should have the following \nunderstanding:  Firstly, the belief of Bhagvãn – ‘He who I have \nattained is undoubtedly Bhagvãn Himself’.  He should also have the \nattributes of an ãstik.  Furthermore, he should realise the divine \npowers of Bhagvãn – ‘This Bhagvãn is the master of Brahm-Mahol, \nGolok, Shvet-Dvip, and all other dhãms.  He is the master of countless \nmillions of brahmãnds and is the all-doer’.  He should never believe \nPurush, Kãl, karma, Mãyã, the three gun, the twenty-four tattvas, or \nBrahmã and the other devs, to be the creators of this brahmãnd.  \nGADHADÃ I \n- 148 - \nInstead, he should realise only Purushottam Bhagvãn to be the \ncreator, and the antaryãmi of all.  Such an understanding, along with \nnishchay in pratyaksha Bhagvãn, is the only way to develop a unique \nlove for Bhagvãn.” \n \n59.5 Muktãnand Swãmi asked further, “Despite having realised the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn, why does a person still not develop a unique \nlove for Bhagvãn?” \n \n59.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “If he has realised the greatness of \nBhagvãn in this way, then he indeed does have a unique love for \nBhagvãn, but he does not realise it.  For example, Hanumãnji \npossessed immense strength, but he did not realise it until someone \nelse revealed it to him.  Also, when Baldevji abducted Pralamb-Ãsur, \nBaldevji possessed tremendous strength, but he himself was \nunaware of this fact.  He only became aware of his strength when he \nwas informed by a divine voice from the sky.  In the same way that \nbhakta does indeed have unique love for Bhagvãn, but he is simply \nnot aware of it.” \n \n59.7 Muktãnand Swãmi asked further, “How can the strength of the love \nbe realised?” \n \n59.8 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “A person realises that he has a unique \nlove for Bhagvãn, by practicing satsang and by listening to the sacred \nshãstras.” \n \n59.9 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked another question.  “Desh, kãl, and kriyã \nbecome either pleasant or unpleasant.  Is this due to sang, or due to \nsome other factor?” \n \n59.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “All desh are a part of the earth, and so \nthey are the same everywhere.  Kãl is also the same everywhere.  \nHowever, wherever there is an extremely powerful person, \nunpleasant desh, unpleasant kãl, and unpleasant kriyã, all become \nGADHADÃ I \n- 149 - \npleasant by his influence.  Conversely, by associating with an \nextremely vile sinner, even pleasant desh, pleasant kãl, and pleasant \nkriyã, become unpleasant.  Therefore, the person is the governing \nfactor in determining whether desh, kãl, and kriyã are pleasant or \nunpleasant. \n \n59.11 “If that person is extremely powerful, he will influence desh, kãl, and \nkriyã, according to his nature, throughout the whole world.  A person \nof slightly less power will be able to influence only one region.  A \nperson who is even less powerful will be able to influence only one \nvillage.  A person of even less power than that will be able to \ninfluence only a neighbourhood or his own household.  In this way, \nthe pleasant and unpleasant influences of desh, kãl, and kriyã are \ndependent upon the purity and impurity of these two types of \npeople.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 59 || 59 ||",

    "content": "Following Ekãntik Dharma \nEradicating Worldly Desires \n \n60.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fãgan vad 1 [29th February, 1820], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in the residential hall of the paramhans in \nDãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes and \nhad covered Himself with a white chãdar.  He had also tied a white \npãgh around His head, which was decorated with tassels of white \nflowers.  Garlands of white flowers were hanging around His neck.  A \nsabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \n60.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Of all spiritual activities, the activity of \neradicating worldly desires, is the greatest.  A person can do this by \nbearing in mind his craving for the vishays – shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, \nGADHADÃ I \n- 150 - \nand gandh – and by thinking, ‘Is my desire for Bhagvãn equal to my \ndesires for the world?  Is it greater?  Or is it less?’  A person should \nexamine himself in this way.  For example, if a person’s ears are \ndrawn to worldly talks just as much as they are drawn to talks \nrelated to Bhagvãn, then he should realise, ‘My desire for Bhagvãn is \nequal to my desire for the world’.  He should examine all the other \nvishays in this way. \n \n60.3 “While examining himself in this way, if a person gradually decreases \nhis worldly desires and increases his desire for Bhagvãn, he begins to \ndevelop an understanding where he views all vishays equally.  After \nsuch calmness has developed, honours and insults will appear to be \nthe same to him.  Moreover, pleasant and unpleasant types of touch \nwill appear to be the same; attractive sights and unattractive sights \nwill appear to be the same; a girl, a young lady and an old woman will \nappear to be the same; gold and rubbish will appear to be the same \nas well.  Similarly, pleasant and unpleasant tastes and smells will also \nappear to be the same.  When a person can instinctively behave in \nthis way, it should be known that his worldly desires have been \novercome.   \n \n60.4 “In fact, to behave above the influence of worldly desires, is the \ndharma of a person who is ekãntik.  But, if some desires do remain, \nthen even in a person is able to attain samãdhi and control his nãdi \nand prãns, those desires will draw him back out of samãdhi.  \nTherefore, only a person who overcomes worldly desires is an \nekãntik bhakta.” \n \n60.5 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “What are the means to eradicate \nworldly desires?” \n \n60.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Firstly, a person requires firm ãtmã-nishthã.  \nSecondly, he should realise the insignificance of the five vishays.  \nThirdly, he should realise the profound greatness of Bhagvãn, and \nGADHADÃ I \n- 151 - \nthink, ‘Bhagvãn is the master of all dhãms – Vaikunth, Golok, Brahm-\nMahol.  So, having attained that Bhagvãn, why should I have affection \nfor the pleasures of the vishays, which are useless?’  A person should \nthink of Bhagvãn’s greatness in this way. \n \n60.7 “He also thinks, ‘If I become unworthy of going to the dhãm of \nBhagvãn, due to some deficiency remaining while worshipping \nBhagvãn, and He were to place me in Indra-Lok or Brahm-Lok, there is \nstill a million-fold more bliss there, in comparison to this world’.  With \nsuch a thought, a person should become free of all desires for the \ninsignificant pleasures of the world.  So, by realising Bhagvãn’s \ngreatness in this way, he becomes free of worldly desires.  Then, he \nfeels, ‘I never did have any desires.  It was all like some kind of illusion.  \nIn reality, I have always been free of desires’.  This is what a person \nexperiences. \n \n60.8 “This ekãntik dharma can only be attained by following the ãgnã of a \nsant who is free of worldly desires, and who has love for Bhagvãn.  It \ncannot be attained merely by reading shãstras.  Even if a person were \nto attempt to repeat those talks exactly, having merely heard them, \nhe would not be able to do so properly.  Therefore, a person can \nattain ekãntik dharma only from someone who has already attained \nthe state of ekãntik dharma.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 60 || 60 ||",

    "content": "The Importance Of Upãsanã At The Time Of Death \nBhagvãn Becomes Bound To His Bhakta \n \n61.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fãgan vad 3 [3rd March, 1820], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the platform under \nthe neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in \nDãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He had tied a white cloth, with a \nGADHADÃ I \n- 152 - \nborder of silken thread, around His head.  He was wearing a white \nkhes, and had covered Himself with a white pachhedi.  He was \nwearing garlands of white flowers around His neck, and tassels of \nwhite flowers were hanging from the left side of His pãgh.  A sabhã of \nmunis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n61.2 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “How can a person remain calm even \nunder the influence of lust, anger, greed, and fear?” \n \n61.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person who has firm ãtmã-nishthã and \nbelieves ‘I am not the body, but I am the ãtmã, which is distinct from \nthe body, and is the knower of all’, never loses his calmness.  On the \nother hand, a person without ãtmã-nishthã may try many other \nmeans, but he cannot remain calm.” \n \n61.4 Brahmãnand Swãmi then asked, “To what extent does ãtmã-nishthã \nactually help a person at the time of death?” \n \n61.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “When faced with the task of crossing a \nriver, a person who knows how to swim, can easily cross it.  On the \nother hand, a person who is unable to swim will be left standing.  \nHowever, when faced with the task of crossing an ocean, both require \nthe aid of a ship.  Similarly, a river (cold and heat, hunger and thirst, \nhonour and insult, happiness and misery) may be crossed by a \nperson with ãtmã-nishthã.  However, death is like an ocean and both \na person with ãtmã-nishthã and a person without it, require the help \nof a ship (nishchay) in Bhagvãn.  Therefore, only the firm refuge of \nBhagvãn is helpful at the time of death.  Ãtmã-nishthã alone is of no \nuse whatsoever at the time of death.  For this reason, a person should \nfirmly develop nishchay in Bhagvãn.” \n \n61.6 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “It is said that siddhis are shown to the \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn.  Does this fact apply only to those whose \nnishchay in Bhagvãn is fickle, or also to those who have firm \nnishchay?” \nGADHADÃ I \n- 153 - \n61.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “Siddhis only appear before those whose \nnishchay in Bhagvãn is continuous.  For others, they are very difficult \nto attain.  In fact, those siddhis are inspired by Bhagvãn Himself to \ntest His bhaktas – ‘Does he have more love for me or for the siddhis?’  \nBhagvãn tests His bhaktas in this way. \n \n61.8 “If the bhakta happens to be completely devoted and desires nothing \nexcept Bhagvãn, is free of worldly desires, and is an ekãntik bhakta, \nthen Bhagvãn Himself becomes bound by that bhakta.  For example, \nVãmanji seized Bali Rãjã’s kingdom, which comprised of the Svarg-\nLok, Mrutyu-Lok and Pãtãl, and covered all fourteen loks with His \nfirst two steps.  Bali Rãjã then offered his own body for Vãmanji to \nplace the third step.  In this way, Bali Rãjã devoutly offered \neverything to Bhagvãn.  Also, despite the fact that Bhagvãn deceived \nBali Rãjã without any fault of his own, Bali still did not falter from His \nbhakti.  On seeing such perfect bhakti for Him, Bhagvãn ultimately \nbecame bound by Bali.  Although Bhagvãn bound Bali Rãjã only for a \nmoment, in the process, Bhagvãn himself became bound by ropes \n(Bali’s unique bhakti).  To this very day, Bhagvãn is forever standing \nat Bali’s gate, never out of Bali Rãjã’s sight, not even for a fraction of a \nsecond. \n \n61.9 “Likewise, after abandoning all other worldly desires and offering \neverything to Bhagvãn, we should also remain as the dãs of Bhagvãn.  \nIn the process, if Bhagvãn happens to inflict more misery upon us, \nthen Bhagvãn Himself will become bound by us.  This is because He \nloves His bhaktas, and is an ocean of kindness.  He becomes bound by \nanyone who offers great bhakti to Him.  As a result, the mind of a \nbhakta who has such loving bhakti, becomes so bound to Bhagvãn, \nthat Bhagvãn is unable to free Himself from His bhakta. \n \n61.10 “Therefore, we should become more pleased as Bhagvãn puts us \nthrough more severe hardships, bearing in mind, ‘The more misery \nBhagvãn inflicts upon me, the more bound He will become to me, so He \nGADHADÃ I \n- 154 - \nwill not be away from me for even a moment’.  With such \nunderstanding, a person should become increasingly pleased as \nBhagvãn imposes more and more hardships.  However, he should \nnever become disheartened in the face of misery or for the sake of \nbodily comforts.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 61 || 61 ||",

    "title": "Acquiring The Qualities Of Bhagvãn",
    "content": "Acquiring The Qualities Of Bhagvãn \nNever Insult A Humble Bhakta \n \n62.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fãgan vad 4 [4th March, 1820], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in the middle of the \ncourtyard of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a \nwhite khes and had covered Himself with a white chãdar.  On His \nhead, He was wearing a white pãgh that was decorated with garlands \nand tassels of white flowers.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n62.2 Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi then asked, “The Shreemad Bhãgvat \nstates:  \n \nsatyam shaucham dayã kshanti-stayã-gaha santosh ãrjavam \nshamo dama-stapaha sãmyam titikshop-ratiha shrutam \n \ngnãnam virakti-raishvarya sauryam tejo balam smruti \nsvatantryam kaushalam kãnti-dhairya-mardav-meva cha \n \nprãgala-bhyam prashnaya shilam shaha ojo balam bhagah \ngãmbhirya sthairya-mãstikyam kirtimãrno-naham-kruti \n \n“These thirty-nine kalyãn-kãri qualities forever dwell in the murti of \nBhagvãn.  How can these qualities be acquired by a sãdhu?” \n \n62.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a sãdhu develops the perfect nishchay in \nBhagvãn, then he will acquire these kalyãn-kãri qualities of Bhagvãn.  \nGADHADÃ I \n- 155 - \nWhat is that nishchay?  Well, he realises that Bhagvãn is not like Kãl, \nnot like karma, not like svabhãv, not like Mãyã, and not like Purush.  \nHe realises Bhagvãn to be distinct from everything, their controller, \nand their cause.  But despite being their cause, He is beyond their \ninfluence.  A person, who has developed a nishchay in pratyaksha \nBhagvãn in this way, will never be deflected.  Even if he hears \nmisleading shãstras, or if he hears the talks of misleading \nphilosophers, or even if his own antah-karans raises doubts within \nhimself, his nishchay in Bhagvãn never weakens in any way. \n \n62.4 “A person with such a nishchay in Bhagvãn is said to have a \nrelationship with Bhagvãn.  Moreover, he naturally acquires the \nqualities of whomever he has a relationship with.  For example, when \nour eyes meet with an oil lamp, the light of that oil lamp enters our \neyes, which expel the darkness around them.  In the same way, a \nperson who has developed a relationship with Bhagvãn by having a \nfirm nishchay in Him, acquires the kalyãn-kãri qualities of Bhagvãn.  \nAs a result, just as Bhagvãn is unattached in all respects and is \ncapable of doing as He chooses, such a bhakta also becomes \nextremely capable and unattached.” \n \n62.5 Nirvikãrãnand Swãmi then asked, “Despite having the nishchay in \nBhagvãn, glorious qualities are still not acquired.  Instead, mãn and \nirshyã are increasing day by day.  What can be the reason for this?” \n \n62.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “Even if a person offers amrut, or \nshingadiyo vachhnãg, or dudh-pãk with sugar, or opium, in Bhagvãn’s \nthãl, the natural qualities in each will still remain the same.  They will \nnot change in any way.  Similarly, a person who is demonic and \nextremely undeserving, will still not abandon his own svabhãv even if \nhe comes into contact with Bhagvãn.  Furthermore, if he happens to \ninsult some humble bhakta of Bhagvãn, then the demonic person will \nsuffer as a result.  This is because Bhagvãn is present in everyone as \nantaryãmi, and He displays His divine powers whenever and \nGADHADÃ I \n- 156 - \nhowever He wishes.  Therefore, insulting such a bhakta is equal to \ninsulting Bhagvãn.  As a result, the offender suffers severely.  For \nexample, Hiranyakashipu was so powerful that he had conquered \nSvarg, Mrutyu-Lok, and Pãtãl.  However, as he harassed Prahlãdji, \nBhagvãn appeared from a pillar in the svarup of Nrusinh, and killed \nHiranyakashipu. \n \n \n62.7 “Bearing this in mind, a bhakta of Bhagvãn should strive to develop \nhumility and should never insult anyone, as Bhagvãn also dwells in \nthe hearts of those who are humble.  Therefore, He will punish \nanyone who insults humble bhaktas.  Realising this, a person should \nnever hurt even the smallest of beings.  However, if a person \nindiscriminately mistreats others out of abhimãn, then Bhagvãn, who \nis the destroyer of abhimãn and who pervades all as antaryãmi, is \nunable to tolerate this.  He will appear in one form or another to \nthoroughly destroy the abhimãn of that person.  Therefore, \nremaining fearful of Bhagvãn, a sãdhu should not retain even the \nslightest abhimãn, nor should he hurt even the smallest of beings.  \nThis is the dharma of a nirmãni sãdhu.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 62 || 62 ||",

    "content": "Perfect Nishchay \nThe Greatness Of Bhagvãn \n \n63.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fãgan vad 7 [7th March, 1820], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on \nthe platform outside the west-facing rooms in front of the mandir of \nShree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white \nchãdar.  He had also tied a white cloth, with a border of silken thread, \naround His head.  Garlands of white flowers adorned His neck, and \nGADHADÃ I \n- 157 - \ntassels of roses had been inserted in His pãgh.  A sabhã of munis, as \nwell as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n63.2 Nrusinhãnand Swãmi then asked, “What kind of thoughts arise in a \nperson who has a deficiency in his nishchay in Bhagvãn?” \n \n63.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person with a deficiency in nishchay \nwould become extremely overjoyed on seeing Bhagvãn displaying \nsome of His powers.  However, when he sees no such display of \ndivine powers, he would become disheartened.  Despite trying, if he \nis unable to eradicate impure thoughts from his heart, he then has a \ndislike towards Bhagvãn.  He would feel, ‘I have bent over backwards \npracticing satsang for so long, yet Bhagvãn still has not eradicated my \nimpure thoughts’.  In this way, he perceives an avgun in Bhagvãn. \n \n63.4 “Despite much effort, if he is unable to free his mind from the objects \nhe cherishes, he then perceives that very same avgun in Bhagvãn.  \nSpecifically, he believes, ‘Just as I have vicious natures, such as kãm \nand krodh, Bhagvãn also has the same natures.  The only difference is \nthat Bhagvãn is regarded as being great’.  A person who has such \ndoubtful thoughts within his heart, should be known to have a \ndeficiency in nishchay; his nishchay cannot be called perfect.” \n \n63.5 Paramchaitanyãnand Swãmi then asked, “Mahãrãj, what are the \nthoughts of a person with perfect nishchay in Bhagvãn?” \n \n63.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person with perfect nishchay feels within, \n‘I have attained all there is to attain.  Wherever pratyaksha Bhagvãn \nresides, that itself is the highest dhãm.  All these sãdhus are like Nãrad \nand the Sanakãdik; all satsangis are like Uddhav, Akrur, Vidur, \nSudãmã, and the cow-herds of Vrundãvan, and female haribhaktas are \nlike the Gopis, Draupadi, Kuntãji, Sitã, Rukmani, Lakshmi, and Pãrvati.  \nNow I have nothing more to achieve.  I have attained Golok, Vaikunth, \nand Brahmpur’.  A person with perfect nishchay has such thoughts \nand experiences extreme joy in his heart.  A person who experiences \nsuch feelings should be known to have perfect nishchay.” \nGADHADÃ I \n- 158 - \n63.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, “A person who has perfectly understood \nthe svarup of Bhagvãn, has nothing left to realise.  Please listen as I \nnow explain the method of realising this.  Hearing this, a person \ndevelops firm nishchay in Bhagvãn. \n \n63.8 “Firstly, he should realise the greatness of Bhagvãn.  To illustrate this, \nconsider the analogy of a great king.  If even his servants and maids \nstay in seven-storey mansions, and their gardens, horses, carriages, \njewellery, and other luxuries make their houses appear as \nmagnificent as Dev-Lok, then imagine how magnificent the darbãr \nand its luxuries of that king must be.  Similarly, consider the loks of \nthe devs of this brahmãnd – Brahmã and the other devs – who follow \nthe ãgnãs of Shree Purushottam Bhagvãn.  If there is no limit to those \nloks and their magnificence, then how can a person possibly \ncomprehend the extent of the magnificence of Virãt-Purush, from \nwhose navel Brahmã was produced?  Furthermore, the master of \ncountless millions of these Virãt-Purush is Purushottam Bhagvãn, \nwhose dhãm is Akshar.  Within that dhãm, countless millions of such \nbrahmãnds float like mere atoms in each and every hair of Akshar.  \nSuch is the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  In that dhãm, Purushottam Bhagvãn \nHimself resides eternally with a divya svarup.  Moreover, countless \ndivya objects exist in that dhãm.  So, if this is the greatness of Akshar, \nthen how can a person possibly comprehend the extent of Bhagvãn’s \ngreatness?  A person with nishchay understands Bhagvãn’s greatness \nin this way. \n \n63.9 “Besides, that which is greater than another is more subtle than the \nother, and is also its cause.  For example, jal is greater than pruthvi, is \nthe cause of that pruthvi, and is more subtle than it as well.  In turn, \ntej is greater than jal, vãyu is greater than tej, and ãkãsh is greater \nthan vãyu.  In the same way, Akshar, Prakruti-Purush, Pradhãn-\nPurush, maha-tattva, and ahankãr are all progressively greater than \neach other, the cause of each other and more subtle than each other.  \nThey also possess a svarup. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 159 - \n63.10 “In comparison, Bhagvãn’s Akshardhãm is extremely large.  Countless \nmillions of brahmãnds float like mere atoms in each of its hairs.  Just \nas an ant moving on the body of a huge elephant appears \ninsignificant, everything else appears insignificant before the \ngreatness of that Akshar.  For example, an ant appears large amidst \nsmall mosquitoes; a scorpion appears large amidst ants; a snake \nappears large amidst scorpions; a kite appears large amidst snakes; a \nbull appears large amidst kites; an elephant appears large amidst \nbulls; a mountain such as Girnãr appears large amidst elephants; and \nMount Meru appears large amidst Girnãr.  In turn, Mount Lokã-Lok \nappears extremely large amidst a mountain such as Meru.  The \npruthvi appears very large in comparison to Mount Lokã-Lok.  In \nturn, jal, the cause of pruthvi, is larger than it and is more subtle than \nit.  In the same way, tej is the cause of jal, vãyu is the cause of tej, \nãkãsh is the cause of vãyu, ahankãr is the cause of ãkãsh, maha-tattva \nis the cause of ahankãr, Pradhãn-Purush are the cause of maha-tattva, \nand Mul-Prakruti and Brahm are the causes of Pradhãn-Purush.  The \ncause of all of these is Akshar-Brahm, which is the dhãm of \nPurushottam Bhagvãn. \n \n63.11 “That Akshar does not have any states of contraction or expansion; it \nforever remains in the same state.  That Akshar also possesses a \nsvarup, but because it is so vast, its svarup cannot be visualised.  For \nexample, the brahmãnd, which has evolved from the twenty-four \ntattvas, is known as Virãt-Purush.  That Virãt-Purush possesses \nfeatures like hands and feet, but because his murti is extremely vast, \nhe is beyond visualisation.  Brahmã walked for a hundred of his own \nyears (one year of Brahmã is equivalent to 315,360,000 human years) \non the stalk of the lotus that emerged from Virãt-Purush’s navel, but \nwas still unable to reach its end.  So, if the end of the lotus cannot be \nreached, how can Virãt-Purush possibly be measured?  Therefore, the \nsvarup of Virãt-Purush cannot be visualised.  In the same way, despite \nhaving a definite svarup, Akshardhãm cannot be visualised.  This is \nbecause countless brahmãnds float within its each and every hair. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 160 - \n63.12 “It is within that Akshardhãm, that Purushottam Bhagvãn Himself \nresides eternally.  By His antaryãmi powers, He resides in His anvay \nsvarup in Akshardhãm, in the countless millions of brahmãnds, and \nalso in the ishvars of those brahmãnds.  Also in that Akshardhãm, \ncountless millions of muktas, who have acquired qualities similar to \nthose of Bhagvãn, remain in Bhagvãn’s sevã.  Also, divine light, \nequivalent to that of millions and millions of suns, radiates from each \nand every hair of those sevaks of Bhagvãn.  Therefore, if those sevaks \nare so great, how can the greatness of their master, Purushottam \nBhagvãn, possibly be described? \n \n63.13 “That extremely powerful Bhagvãn, enters Akshar and assumes the \nsvarup of Akshar.  He then assumes the svarup of Mul-Prakruti-\nPurush, and then the svarup of Pradhãn-Purush.  Then, He enters the \ntwenty-four tattvas produced from Pradhãn, and assumes that \nsvarup.  He then enters Virãt-Purush produced from those tattvas, \nand assumes that svarup.  He then enters Brahmã, Vishnu, and Shiv, \nand assumes their svarups. \n \n63.14 “In this way, that Bhagvãn, who is extremely powerful, extremely \nluminous, and extremely great, contains His own spiritual powers \nand divine light with Himself and becomes like a human being for the \nkalyãn of jeevs.  He assumes a svarup that allows people to have His \ndarshan, perform His sevã, and offer worship to Him.  For example, a \ntiny thorn that has pricked an ant’s leg cannot be removed with a \nspear or a pin.  It can only be removed using an extremely fine \nneedle.  In the same way, Bhagvãn limits His own greatness within \nHimself, and assumes an extremely modest svarup.  Just as Agni \nconstrains his own light and flames to assume a human svarup, \nsimilarly, Bhagvãn also suppresses His own powers and acts as a \nhuman for the kalyãn of jeevs.  However, a foolish person thinks, ‘Why \ndoes Bhagvãn not manifest any powers?’  But, he does not realise that \nBhagvãn deliberately conceals His powers for the sake of the kalyãn \nof jeevs.  After all, if He were to manifest His own greatness, then even \nGADHADÃ I \n- 161 - \nthe brahmãnd would diminish into insignificance.  Then, what can be \nsaid of jeevs? \n \n63.15 “Kãl, karma, and Mãyã are incapable of binding a person who has \ndeveloped such firm nishchay, coupled with an understanding of \nBhagvãn’s greatness, in his heart.  Therefore, he who understands \nBhagvãn perfectly in this way, has nothing left to achieve.” \n \n63.16 Then, Nityãnand Swãmi asked, “When Bhagvãn assumes a human \nsvarup, does He always do so sequentially in the order described, or \ncan He also assume a human svarup directly?” \n \n63.17 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “For Bhagvãn, the sequential order is not \nnecessary.  For example, a person who takes a dives into a pond can \nemerge from wherever he wishes – either at the same entry point of \nthe dive, or at the banks, or anywhere nearby.  Similarly, if He so \nwishes, Purushottam Bhagvãn can take a ‘dive’ in His Akshardhãm \nand directly assume a human svarup, or if He wishes, He can assume \na human svarup following the sequential order.” \n \n63.18 Following this explanation, Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, “I shall now \nbriefly explain the characteristics of a person with extremely firm \nnishchay, so please listen attentively.  Firstly, a person with perfect \nnishchay will do anything asked of him on the path of pravrutti, \nwithout ever backing away, even if he has intense tyãg.  Moreover, he \ndoes not do it reluctantly; he does it willingly.  The second \ncharacteristic is that regardless of any svabhãv he may possess, even \nif it cannot be eradicated by a million ways, if he senses Bhagvãn’s \ninsistence in abandoning that svabhãv, he abandons it immediately.  \nThe third characteristic is that despite his own avgun, he is unable to \nlive without the talks, kirtans, and the sant of Bhagvãn, even for a \nmoment.  He finds avgun only within himself and thoroughly \nperceives the gun of a sant.  He also understands the great glory of \nthe talks and kirtans of Bhagvãn, as well as of the sant of Bhagvãn.  A \nGADHADÃ I \n- 162 - \nperson with such understanding should be known to have perfect \nnishchay.  Furthermore, if a person with this nishchay were to \ndisobey the vartmãns due to prãrabdha, he would still not fall from \nthe path of kalyãn.  In comparison, regardless of how great a tyãgi a \nperson may be, without this nishchay his kalyãn is not guaranteed.” \n \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 63 || 63 ||",

    "content": "The Relationship Between Sharir And Shariri \n \n64.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fãgan vad 9 [9th March, 1820], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on \nthe platform outside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr \nin Gadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself \nwith another black-bordered khes.  He has also tied a white cloth \nwith a border of silken thread around His head.  Around His neck, He \nwas wearing a new kanthi made from tulsi beads.  A sabhã of munis, \nas well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n64.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then asked the munis, “The Shrutis mention that the \nãtmã and Akshar are the sharir of Purushottam, who is Bhagvãn.  That \nãtmã and Akshar are not subject to change, and are beyond the \ninfluences of mãyã.  Moreover, like Bhagvãn, the ãtmã and Akshar are \ngreater than Mãyã.  Then, how can that ãtmã and Akshar be described \nas the sharir of Bhagvãn?  This is because the sharir of a jeev is totally \ndifferent from the jeev itself and is subject to change, whereas the \njeev inside the body, is not subject to change.  Therefore, just as the \nbody of the jeev and the jeev itself are totally different, similarly, \nthere should be the same degree of difference between Purushottam, \nand the ãtmã and Akshar, which are the sharir of Purushottam.  \nPlease explain how they are different.” \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 163 - \n64.3 All the munis answered according to their understanding, but no one \nwas able to provide a precise answer. \n \n64.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Allow me to answer.  The ãtmã and \nAkshar make up the sharir of Purushottam Bhagvãn, and they are \npervaded, dependent, and powerless.  In what way?  Well, by means \nof His antaryãmi powers, Bhagvãn pervades the ãtmã and Akshar, \nwhereas the ãtmã and Akshar are the ones who are pervaded.  \nBhagvãn is independent, whereas the ãtmã and Akshar are \ndependent upon Bhagvãn.  Furthermore, Bhagvãn is all-powerful, \nwhereas the ãtmã and Akshar are totally powerless before Him.  In \nthis way, Bhagvãn is the shariri of both the ãtmã and Akshar, and \nthese two are the sharir of Bhagvãn. \n \n64.5 “That shariri, Purushottam Bhagvãn, possesses an eternal divya murti.  \nWith His antaryãmi powers, Bhagvãn resides as the ãtmã of all the \nãtmãs.  These ãtmãs pervade their physical bodies, and are the \ndrashtã of these bodies.  Bhagvãn also resides in all the physical \nbodies, which are pervaded in relation to the ãtmãs.  These physical \nbodies are the drashya of ãtmã.  In this way, Purushottam Bhagvãn is \nthe ãtmã of all.  When referred to in the shãstras as the ãtmã of \ndrashya, which has a svarup, Purushottam Bhagvãn is also described \nto have a svarup.  When referred to in the shãstras as the ãtmã of the \ndrashtã, He is described as nirãkãr.  However, in reality Purushottam \nBhagvãn is different from both the drashya, which has a svarup, and \nthe ãtmã, which does not have a svarup.  He eternally possesses a \ndefinite svarup, which is not an ordinary, worldly svarup.  Moreover, \ndespite possessing a definite svarup, He is the drashtã of both the \ndrashtã and the drashya. \n \n64.6 “Furthermore, Purushottam Bhagvãn is the inspirer of both the ãtmã \nand Akshar, is independent from them, and is their controller; He \npossesses all spiritual powers; He is greater than even Akshar, which \nis greater than everything.  Out of compassion, that Purushottam \nGADHADÃ I \n- 164 - \nBhagvãn appears as a human being on this earth, for the kalyãn of \njeevs.  Understanding Him to eternally possess a divya svarup, a \nperson who offers bhakti and upãsanã to Him acquires qualities \nsimilar to those of Bhagvãn, as well as countless other spiritual \npowers. \n \n64.7 “After such a person’s ãtmã has attained the state of brahm, he \nconstantly remains in the sevã of Purushottam Bhagvãn with love and \ngreat devotion.  On the other hand, a person who performs dhyãn \nupon Bhagvãn and offers upãsanã while believing Him to be nirãkãr, \nis merged into brahm-sushupti.  He never returns from this state, nor \ndoes he ever acquire any spiritual powers from Bhagvãn.” \n \n64.8 Finally, Shreeji Mahãrãj added, “I have delivered this talk having \nexperienced it directly myself.  Therefore, there is not a trace of \ndoubt about it.  Moreover, these facts can be understood only from a \nperson who firmly believes that Bhagvãn is forever divya and sãkãr.  \nThey can never be understood from others.  Therefore, these facts \nshould be thoroughly remembered by all.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 64 || 64 ||",

    "content": "Gnãn-Shakti, Kriyã-Shakti, And Ichhã-Shakti \n \n65.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fãgan vad 14 [13th March, 1820], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow \nplaced on the veranda outside His bedroom in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr \nin Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of \nparamhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n65.2 While the kathã was being read, Shreeji Mahãrãj called the senior \nparamhans near Him.  When the kathã was completed, Shreeji \nGADHADÃ I \n- 165 - \nMahãrãj said, “Now, all the senior sãdhus seated here will answer \neach other’s questions.  This will reveal their level of intelligence.” \n \n65.3 Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi then asked Premãnand Swãmi, “How is \nãkãsh created, and how is it destroyed?” \n \n65.4 Paramãnand Swãmi attempted to answer the question, but was \nunable to provide a precise answer. \n \n65.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “When a child is initially in its mother’s \nwomb and at the time of its birth, the cavities of its heart and other \nindriyas are small.  But, as the child grows, those cavities develop; \nand the ãkãsh within increase as well.  However, when the child \nbecomes old, the cavities of its indriyas decrease in size, and the \nãkãsh within also decrease.  Similarly, when Virãt’s body is produced, \nãkãsh appears to be created in the cavity of his heart and other \ninternal organs.  Also, when Virãt’s body is destroyed, the ãkãsh \nwithin appears to be destroyed as well.  This is how ãkãsh is created \nand destroyed.  However, just as Prakruti-Purush are eternal, the \nãkãsh that is the supporter of all is also eternal.  It is not subject to \ncreation and destruction.  However, ãkãsh is created and destroyed \nthrough samãdhi.  A person who experiences samãdhi knows its \nmethod.” \n \n65.6 Paramãnand Swãmi then asked Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi, “How \ndoes the sushumnã nãdi reside within the body and outside of the \nbody?” \n \n65.7 Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi attempted to answer the question, but \ncould not do adequately. \n \n65.8 Shreeji Mahãrãj then replied, “Whatever is present in this brahmãnd, \nis also present within this body.  The only difference is that in the \nbody the scale is small, whereas in the brahmãnd the scale is large.  In \nGADHADÃ I \n- 166 - \nfact, the arrangement of the brahmãnd is the same as that of the \nbody.  For example, just as there are rivers in the brahmãnd, similarly \nthere are blood vessels in the body; just as there are oceans in the \nbrahmãnd, similarly water is present in the abdomen of the body; \nand just as the sun and the moon are present in the brahmãnd, \nsimilarly the idã nãdi and pingalã nãdi house the sun and moon in the \nbody.  In the same way, just as other objects are present in the \nbrahmãnd, they are also present in the body. \n \n65.9 “Also, the nãdis of the indriyas in this body are coupled with those of \nthe brahmãnd.  When a person acquires control over the tongue, he \nattains Varun-Dev; when a person acquires control over speech, he \nattains Agni-Dev; when a person acquires control over the skin, he \nattains Vãyu-Dev; when he acquires control over the genitals, he \nattains Prajãpati; and when a person acquires control over the hands, \nhe attains Indra.  In the same way, when a person controls the \nbrahm-randhra – the end portion of the sushumnã nãdi located in the \nheart – he reaches the arrogant dev by the name of Vaishvãnar Agni, \nwhich resides in the shishumãr chakra.  It is then that he sees the \nuninterrupted path of light from the brahm-randhra to Prakruti-\nPurush.  That path of light is known as sushumnã.  This is how the \nsushumnã nãdi resides in the body and in the brahmãnd.” \n \n65.10 Paramãnand Swãmi asked Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi another \nquestion, “Which state is destroyed first – the jãgrat state, the svapna \nstate, or the sushupti state?” \n \n65.11 As Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi was unable to answer that question, \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “When a person focuses on the svarup of \nBhagvãn with love in the jãgrat state, the jãgrat state is destroyed \nfirst, then the svapna state, and finally the sushupti state.  When the \nmind thinks of and focuses on the murti of Bhagvãn in the svapna \nstate, the svapna state is destroyed first, then the jãgrat state, and \nfinally the sushupti state.  Furthermore, when a person attains the \nGADHADÃ I \n- 167 - \nstate of upsham, while concentrating on the svarup of Bhagvãn, the \nsushupti state is destroyed first, then the jãgrat state, and finally the \nsvapna state.”  Shreeji Mahãrãj answered the question in this way. \n \n65.12 Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi then asked Paramãnand Swãmi \nanother question, “How should a person understand the ‘ichhã-\nshakti’, ‘gnãn-shakti’, and ‘kriyã-shakti’ of Bhagvãn?” \n \n65.13 Laughing, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Even you probably do not know the \nanswer to that question.”  He then began to give the answer Himself.  \n“When sattva-gun is predominant, the rewards of any karmas \nperformed by a jeev are experienced in the jãgrat state.  When rajo-\ngun is predominant, the rewards of any karmas performed are \nexperienced in the svapna state.  When tamo-gun is predominant, the \nrewards of any karmas performed are experienced in the sushupti \nstate. \n \n65.14 “When a jeev enters the state of jãgrat, it becomes inert like a slab of \nstone, and retains no type of consciousness, such as, ‘I am a pundit, or \nI am a fool; I have done this task, or I want to do this task; this is my \ngender, or this is my varna, or this is my ãshram; this is my name, or my \nappearance is like this.  Am I a dev, or am I a human?  Am I a child, or \nam I old?  Am I good, or am I a sinner?’ and so on.  No such \nconsciousness is retained.  When a jeev enters this state, Bhagvãn \nawakens it from unconsciousness through His gnãn-shakti and makes \nit aware of its actions.  This is known as gnãn-shakti, the power of \nunderstanding.  Furthermore, whatever action a jeev engages in, it \ndoes so with the support of what is known as Bhagvãn’s kriyã-shakti, \nthe power of application.  Finally, whatever object is desired by the \njeev, is acquired with the help of what is known as Bhagvãn’s ichhã-\nshakti, the power of free will. \n \n65.15 “Moreover, the three states of jãgrat, svapna, and sushupti \nexperienced by a jeev are not due to the consequences of its own \nGADHADÃ I \n- 168 - \nkarmas alone.  They are experienced only when Bhagvãn, the giver of \nthe rewards of karmas, allows the jeev to do so.  When a jeev, \nindulging in the rewards of the jãgrat state, wishes to enter the \nsvapna state, it cannot do so independently.  This is because Bhagvãn, \nrestrains its vrutti.  Similarly, if it wishes to enter the jãgrat state \nfrom the svapna, it is unable to do so; nor can it enter the sushupti \nstate or emerge from it to enter the svapna or jãgrat sates.  It is only \nwhen Bhagvãn allows it to indulge in the rewards of the karmas of \nthe particular state that it is able to indulge in them.  However, a jeev \ncannot indulge in the rewards of its karmas according to its own will \nor as a direct consequence of karmas.  This is how a person should \nunderstand the gnãn-shakti, kriyã-shakti, and ichhã-shakti of \nBhagvãn.” \n \n65.16 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered the question in this way, out of \ncompassion. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 65 || 65 ||",

    "content": "Misinterpreting The Words Of The Shãstras \nThe Four Avatãrs Of Bhagvãn \n \n66.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fãgan vad Amãs [14th March, 1820], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a large decorated \nbedstead on the platform outside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a khes with a black \nborder, and had covered Himself with a white pachhedi.  He had also \ntied a white feto around His head.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n66.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “The Shreemad Bhãgvat describes \nVãsudev, Sankarshan, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha – four avatãrs of \nBhagvãn.  In some places they are described as sagun, whereas in \nGADHADÃ I \n- 169 - \nothers places they are described as nirgun.  The term nirgun is used \nin reference to Vãsudev Bhagvãn, and the term sagun is used in \nreference to Sankarshan, Aniruddha, and Pradyumna.  However, \nwhen described as nirgun, the minds of the listener and the reader \nare confused, and they draw the conclusion that Bhagvãn does not \npossess a svarup.  However, this is their misunderstanding. \n \n66.3 “Besides, the words of the shãstras cannot be understood in their \ntrue context by anyone except an ekãntik bhakta.  These are words \nsuch as, ‘Bhagvãn is nirãkãr, luminous, nirgun, and all-pervading’.  On \nhearing these descriptions, a fool concludes that the shãstras \ndescribe Bhagvãn as being nirãkãr.  On the other hand, an ekãntik \nbhakta realises, ‘When the shãstras describe Bhagvãn as being nirãkãr \nand nirgun, they are referring to the fact that He does not possess a \nmãyik svarup or mãyik characteristics.  In reality, His svarup is forever \ndivya, and He possesses countless kalyãn-kãri qualities’. \n \n66.4 “There is also a reference to Bhagvãn being an immense mass of \ndivine light.  However, if there is no murti, then there can be no light \neither.  Therefore, that light must definitely be from that murti.  For \nexample, take the murti of Agni.  When flames radiate from his murti, \nonly the flames – not the murti of Agni – are seen.  However, a wise \nman realises that the flames are definitely radiating from Agni’s \nmurti.  Similarly, water radiates from the murti of Varun.  Although \nonly the water – not the murti of Varun – is visible, a wise man \nrealises that the water radiates from Varun’s murti.  In the same way, \nthe divine light, which has the intensity of millions of suns and is like \nbrahm-sattã, is the light of the murti of Purushottam Bhagvãn. \n \n66.5 “The shãstras also state, ‘A thorn is used to remove a thorn, and then \nboth are discarded.  Similarly, Bhagvãn assumes a physical body to \nrelieve the earth of its burdens.  Then, having relieved the earth of its \nburden, He discards the physical body’.  Hearing such words, the \nfoolish people are misled into the understanding that Bhagvãn is \nnirãkãr, and they fail to realise the murti of Bhagvãn as being divya. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 170 - \n \n66.6 “However, an ekãntik bhakta has the following understanding:  ‘To \nfulfil Arjun’s pledge, both Shree Krishna Bhagvãn and Arjun left \nDvãrikã on his chariot to fetch the Brãhman’s son.  Crossing Mount \nLokã-Lok, they cut through Mãyã’s veil of darkness with the Sudarshan \nChakra.  Driving the chariot through that darkness, they entered a \nmass of light.  There, they collected the Brãhman’s son from Bhumã-\nPurush before returning.  This was only because Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn’s murti was divya.  Due to the power of that divinity, the \nwooden chariot and the horses – despite being composed of the five \nbhuts – all became divya and beyond Mãyã, like chaitanya.  Had their \nmurtis not become divya, they would never have been able to rise above \nMãyã.  After all, everything that has evolved from Mãyã ultimately \nmerges into Mãyã, and can never reach Brahm, which is beyond Mãyã’.  \nTherefore, it was due to the powers of Bhagvãn’s murti that the mãyik \nobjects become non-mãyik.  A fool has the understanding that \nBhagvãn’s murti is mãyik, whereas an ekãntik sãdhu has the \nunderstanding that Bhagvãn’s murti is greater than Akshar.  He also \nunderstands that Purushottam Bhagvãn possesses a definite murti, \nand is the ãtmã of countless millions of brahm-rup muktas, and also \nof Akshardhãm. \n \n66.7 “Therefore, regardless of which shãstras are being read, if they \ndescribe Bhagvãn as being nirgun, a person should realise that they \nare merely praising the glory of Bhagvãn’s murti.  However, Bhagvãn \nalways possesses a definite murti.  A person who realises this is \nknown as an ekãntik bhakta.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 66 || 66 ||",

    "content": "Acquiring The Qualities Of A Sat-Purush \n \n67.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Chaitra sud 7 [21st March, 1820], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in the residential hall of the \nGADHADÃ I \n- 171 - \nmunis in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely \nin white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n67.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then asked the munis, “There is a sat-purush who has \nno love at all for the pleasure of this world.  He has desires only for \nthe dhãm of Bhagvãn and the svarup of Bhagvãn.  He also wishes the \nsame for whoever associates with him.  He feels, ‘As this person has \nassociated with me, it would be of great benefit to him if his desires for \nthis world are eradicated, and his love for Bhagvãn is developed’.  \nFurthermore, all the efforts that are made by the sat-purush, are only \nfor acquiring bliss after attaining the dhãm of Bhagvãn after death.  \nHe never does anything for the sake of bodily comforts.  So, with \nwhat understanding can a mumukshu acquire the qualities of such a \nsat-purush, and what understanding causes such qualities to not be \nacquired?  That is the question?” \n \n67.3 Muktãnand Swãmi replied, “If a person views such a sat-purush, who \nhas no desire for the pleasures of this world, and accepts whatever \nwords are uttered by him, then that mumukshu will acquire the \nqualities of that sat-purush.  A person who does not do so will not \nacquire those qualities.” \n \n67.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “That answer is correct, but please listen \nas I explain the method of understanding by which a mumukshu can \nacquire the qualities of the great sat-purush.  A person perceives the \nqualities of such a sat-purush, who has no love for anything except \nBhagvãn, by believing, ‘This sant is extremely great.  Despite thousands \nof people standing before Him with folded hands, he does not have the \nslightest desire for the pleasures of the world.  As for me, I am \nextremely insignificant, and I am solely attached to worldly pleasures.  I \ndo not understand anything at all about Bhagvãn.  Shame on me’.  In \nthis way, he feels guilt and perceives the gun of the great sant.  He \nalso feels guilt after realising his own avgun.  While repeating in this \nGADHADÃ I \n- 172 - \nway, vairãgya arises in his heart, and then, he acquires qualities \nsimilar to those of that sat-purush. \n \n67.5 “Now, please listen as I describe the characteristics of a person in \nwhose heart the qualities of the sat-purush are never acquired.  Such \na person believes, ‘The sat-purush is said to be great, yet he has no \nkind of common sense whatsoever.  He does not even know how to eat \nand drink properly, nor does he know how to dress properly.  Bhagvãn \nhas given him abundant pleasures, yet he does not know how to enjoy \nthem.  Moreover, when he gives anything to anyone, he does so at \nrandom’.  In this way, he perceives countless types of avgun in the \nsat-purush.  Such a cruel person never acquires the qualities of a sat-\npurush.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 67 || 67 ||",

    "content": "Bhagvãn Resides In The Eight Types Of Murtis And In A Sant \n \n68.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Chaitra sud 9 [23rd March, 1820], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead \nunder the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan \nin Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes \nand had covered Himself with a white chãdar.  Around His head, He \nhad tied a white cloth with border of silken thread.  A sabhã of munis, \nas well as haribhaktas from various places had gathered before Him. \n \n68.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Allow me to ask a question.” \n \n68.3 The munis responded by saying, “Please do ask.” \n \n68.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “For one month during the famine of \nSamvat 1869, whenever I entered samãdhi, I felt I had gone to \nGADHADÃ I \n- 173 - \nPurushottam-Puri, where I entered and resided in the murti of Shree \nJagan-Nãthji.  That murti may appear to be wooden, but through its \neyes I observed everything.  I observed both the bhakti and the \ndeceitful ways of the mandir’s pujãri.  In the same way, those people \nin our satsang who have mastered samãdhi can also enter the bodies \nof others through samãdhi, and see and hear everything.  The \nshãstras also mention that Shukji spoke through the body of a tree.  \nTherefore, a great sat-purush or Bhagvãn can enter wherever they \nwish. \n \n68.5 “Bhagvãn has given eight types of murtis for worship by His ãgnã – \nshaili (stone), dãrumayi (wood), lauhi (metal), lepyã (earth or \nsandalwood paste), lekhyã (engraved or drawn), saikati (sand), \nmanimayi (gems), and manomayi (mental).  Bhagvãn Himself \npersonally enters those murtis and resides within them.  A bhakta of \nBhagvãn, who worships those murtis, should maintain the same \nrespect for them as he does for pratyaksha Bhagvãn.  \n \n68.6 “In the same way, Bhagvãn also resides in the heart of a sant.  \nTherefore, a sant should also be respected.  In spite of that, a bhakta \ntotally fails to respect him.  He considers a murti to be merely a \npainting or to be made of stone or other materials.  Furthermore, he \nlooks upon that sant as an ordinary human being.  But Bhagvãn \nHimself has said, ‘I forever reside in the eight types of murtis and in a \nsant’.  Still, that bhakta behaves disrespectfully before the murtis of \nBhagvãn and before a sant, not at all fearing Bhagvãn.  Does such a \nperson have nishchay in Bhagvãn, or not?  That is the question.” \n \n68.7 The paramhans replied, “As he does not realise Bhagvãn to be \nantaryãmi and fails to respect Him, such a bhakta does not have \nnishchay in Bhagvãn at all.  He does not have nishchay, so his bhakti is \nlike that of a hypocrite.” \n \n68.8 Shreeji Mahãrãj then asked further, “Will such a bhakta attain kalyãn, \nor not?” \nGADHADÃ I \n- 174 - \n68.9 The sãdhus replied, “No, he will not attain kalyãn.” \n \n68.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj then continued, “A person who develops such a \nnãstik attitude towards the murtis of Bhagvãn and a sant, will not \nstop there.  He will also develop nãstik feelings towards the \npratyaksha svarup of Bhagvãn whom he worships.  He will also \ndevelop nãstik feelings towards the dhãms of Bhagvãn, such as Golok \nand Brahmpur.  Furthermore, he will come to believe that the \ncreation, sustenance, and destruction of this universe are due to Kãl, \nMãyã, and karma, but not due to the will of Bhagvãn.  In this way, he \nwill become a firm nãstik.” \n \n68.11 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “Is this nãstik attitude due to a \nperson’s past karmas, or due to the influence of kusang?” \n \n68.12 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The sole cause of the development of \nsuch a nãstik attitude is listening to the shãstras of nãstiks and \nkeeping the company of a person who has faith in those shãstras.  \nFurthermore, kãm, krodh, lobh, ahankãr, mãn, and irshyã also cause a \nnãstik attitude to develop.  A person who possesses any one of these \nsvabhãvs, will not be able to believe the talks of even sãdhus, such as \nNãrad and the Sanakãdik. \n \n68.13 “When is such a nãstik attitude overcome?  Well, when a person \nlistens to talks of the leelãs of Bhagvãn, such as the creation, \nsustenance, and destruction of the universe as described in ãstik \nshãstras, like the Shreemad Bhãgvat, and also understands the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn and a sant, the nãstik attitude is overcome and \nan ãstik attitude develops.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 68 || 68 || \nGADHADÃ I \n- 175 -",

    "content": "Non-Violence \nNever Think Cruelly Of Others \nDo Not Associate With A Nãstik \n \n69.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Chaitra sud 12 [26th March, 1820], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms in front on \nthe mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, \nas well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n69.2 Following the sandhyã ãrti of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan and the \n‘Nãrãyan’ dhun, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked the munis, “What exactly is \ndharma?  Please base your reply on the shãstras.  The question arises \nbecause even the kings of the past who indulged in violence, did not \nharm those who took their refuge, nor did they allow harm to others.  \nSo, is the sin committed by killing others, considered the same as the \nsin of killing a person who has sought his refuge?” \n \n69.3 The munis attempted to reply according to their own understanding, \nbut due to queries raised by Shreeji Mahãrãj, no one was able to offer \na satisfactory answer.  All the munis then said, “Mahãrãj, we would \nlike to put the same question to you.  Violence (hinsã) performed on \nanimals, as part of a sacrifice or some other ritual, is considered to be \ndharma.  But, non-violence (ahinsã) is also considered to be dharma.  \nPlease clarify this.” \n \n69.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “Dharma involving violence is for the \nattainment of dharma, arth, and kãm.  Moreover, the dharma which \npermits violence is for the purpose of limiting violence.  Non-\nviolence, on the other hand, is for the attainment of kalyãn – which is \nthe dharma of a sãdhu.  Dharma involving violence is for fulfilling \nworldly desires, but it is not for the attainment of kalyãn, whereas \nnon-violence is solely for the purpose of attaining kalyãn.  \nGADHADÃ I \n- 176 - \n69.5 “Therefore, for both grahasthas and tyãgis only non-violence has \nbeen cited for the attainment of kalyãn.  For example, Uparichar-Vasu \nRãjã ruled over a kingdom and still followed a non-violent lifestyle.  \nTherefore, a sãdhu should not bear hatred towards anyone by \nthought, word, or deed.  Neither should he keep any form of \naggression.  Instead, he should behave as a dãs of a dãs with all. \n \n69.6 “In comparison, having an aggressive personality is the dharma of a \nwicked person, and behaving in a calm manner is the dharma of a \nsãdhu.  Someone may then ask, ‘How is it possible to maintain the \ncharacteristics of a sãdhu, while trying to make thousands of people \nfollow their niyams?’  Well, the reply to the question is that \nYudhishthir Rãjã reigned over a kingdom stretching for thousands of \nmiles, yet he managed to maintain the qualities of a sãdhu.  \nConversely, there may be thousands like Bhimsen who intimidate \nothers and are unable to change their ways despite being lectured.  In \nfact, there is no shortage of people with such an aggressive nature; \nthere are countless such people.  However, to be a sãdhu, is indeed \nvery difficult.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 69 || 69 ||",

    "content": "Saved From Death By The Prick Of A Thorn \n \n70.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Chaitra sud 15 [29th March, 1820], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda \noutside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  \nHe had tied a white cloth with a border of silken thread around His \nhead.  He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a \nwhite chãdar.  With His hand, He was turning a mãlã of tulsi beads.  A \nsabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 177 - \n70.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Senior paramhans, please ask questions \namongst yourselves.  If a grahastha has a question, he may ask the \nparamhans.” \n \n70.3 Kãkã-Bhãi, a bhakta from the village of Rojkã, then asked Nityãnand \nSwãmi, “Deep within a person’s heart, something signals him to \nindulge in the vishays, while something else says ‘no’ and discourages \nhim from indulging in them.  What is it that says ‘no’, and what is it \nthat says ‘yes’?” \n \n70.4 Nityãnand Swãmi replied, “It is the jeev that says ‘no’, and it is the \nmind that says ‘yes’.” \n \n70.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Allow me to answer that question.  From \nthe very day we began to understand and realise who our parents \nwere, they taught us: ‘This is your mother and this is your father; this is \nyour kãkã and this is your brother; this is your mãmã and this is your \nsister; this is your mãmi and this is your kãki; this is your mãsi and this \nis your buffalo; this is your cow and this is your horse; these are your \nclothes and this is your house; this is your mansion, this is your farm, \nand this is your jewellery’.  These words of kusangis have been \nimprinted in the mind.  How are they imprinted?  Well, it is like the \nsmall pieces of glass that women attach into works of embroidery, \nwhere the mind represents the embroidery, and the jeev represents \nthe piece of glass.  In this way, the words and the sights of those \nkusangis, along with the other types of vishays, have become \nimprinted in the mind. \n \n70.6 “Then, after the person enters satsang, the sant talks about the glory \nof Bhagvãn, how to reject the vishays, and also explains that the \nworld is perishable.  In this way, the words and the sight of the sant \ndwell in the person’s mind.   \n \n70.7 “Take the example of two armies facing each other.  In the battlefield \nof Kurukshetra, the armies of the Kauravs and the Pãndavs stood \nfacing each other and fought with arrows, spears, and various other \nGADHADÃ I \n- 178 - \ntypes of weapons.  Some fought with swords, some fought with \nmaces, and some fought with their bare hands.  In the process, some \nlost their heads, others injured their thighs, and many were \nslaughtered.  Similarly, in the person’s antah-karans, there are forms \nof the kusangis standing armed with their weapons (five vishays).  \nOpposite them, are also forms of the sant standing armed with \nweapons in the form of words such as, ‘Bhagvãn is satya, the world is \nperishable, and the vishays are false’.  Therefore, a mutual conflict \nexists between these two sets of words.  When the force of the \nkusangis prevails, a desire to indulge in the vishays arises.  When the \nforce of the sant prevails, the desire to indulge in the vishays \ndisappears.  In this way, there is a conflict within the antah-karans.  \nThere is a shlok: \n \nyatra yogesh-varaha krushno yatra pãrtho dhanur-dharaha \ntatra shreer-vijayo bhootir-dhruva neetir-matir-mama \n \n“The meaning of this shlok is: Only where there is Yogeshvar, Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn, and where there is the great archer Arjun, there is \nLakshmi, victory, divine powers, and resolute morality exist’.  \nTherefore, a person should have the firm belief that victory belongs \nto the person on whose side these sãdhus happen to be.” \n \n70.8 Kãkã-Bhãi then asked further, “Mahãrãj, by what means can the force \nof a sant increase and the force of the kusangis decrease?” \n \n70.9 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The kusangis that reside internally and \nexternally, are both one.  Also, the sant residing within and the sant \nresiding externally, are both one.  The force of the internal kusangis \nincreases with the encouragement of the external kusangis.  In the \nsame way, the force of the sant within increases with the \nencouragement of the sant residing externally.  Therefore, by \navoiding the company of external kusangis, and by keeping the \ncompany of only the sant residing externally, the force of the kusangis \ndecreases and the force of the sant increases.”  That is how Shreeji \nMahãrãj answered that question. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 179 - \n70.10 Again, Kãkã-Bhãi asked, “Mahãrãj, there is a person who has \novercome the fight against kusangis, and for whom only the force of \nthe sant is the strongest.  There is another person whose conflict is \nstill on-going.  Of the two, when the first person dies, there is no \ndoubt that he will attain the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  But, please tell us \nwhat will be the fate of the second person, whose conflict is still on-\ngoing, when he dies?” \n \n70.11 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “In a battle, one person may face Vãniyãs \nor someone from a weak social-caste.  As a result, he may easily win.  \nAnother person is confronted by an army of Arabs, Rãjputs, Kãthis, \nand Kolis, who are very difficult to conquer, and are certainly not as \neasy to defeat as the Vãniyãs.  Therefore, his fight continues.  In the \nprocess of such fighting, if he wins, then all is well and good.  But, if \nwhile fighting he does not give in to his opponents, despite their \nattempts, and if he were to die at that time, would his master not be \naware of his courageous efforts?  Would He not appreciate that, \ncompared to the person who faced the easy opposition of the \nVãniyãs, this person faced frightening opposition that was difficult to \novercome?  The master would indeed be well aware of both \nsituations.  In the same way, Bhagvãn is sure to help such a person as \nyou have described.  He will believe, ‘This person is faced with the \noverwhelming force of fluctuating thoughts, yet he is still putting up a \nbrave fight.  Therefore, he deserves to be congratulated’.  Realising \nthis, Bhagvãn does help him.  For this reason, a person should remain \ncarefree and not worry in the least.  He should continue to worship \nBhagvãn in the same way, keep the sant the most important, and stay \naway from kusangis.”  Shreeji Mahãrãj replied joyfully in this way. \n \n70.12 Jeevã-Bhãi, from the village Jaskã, then asked Nityãnand Swãmi, \n“How can we develop unfaltering nishchay in Bhagvãn?” \n \n70.13 Nityãnand Swãmi replied, “If a person avoids the company of \nkusangis and constantly keeps the company of sãdhus, then listening \nto the talks of those sãdhus will lead to the development of \nGADHADÃ I \n- 180 - \nunfaltering nishchay in Bhagvãn.  However, if he keeps the company \nof kusangis, unfaltering nishchay will not develop.” \n \n70.14 Again Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Allow me to answer that question.  A \nperson should develop nishchay in Bhagvãn for the sole purpose of \nthe kalyãn of his jeev, but not out of a desire for some material object.  \nFor example, ‘If I practice satsang, my ill body will recover’, or ‘If I am \nchildless, I will have a son’, or ‘If my sons are dying, they will live’, or ‘If \nI am poor, I will become rich’, or ‘If I practice satsang, I will regain my \nlost land’.  A person should not practice satsang while keeping desires \nfor material possessions.  If a person does practice satsang with such \ndesires, then he may become a very loyal satsangi if those desires are \nfulfilled.  However, if his desires are not fulfilled, his nishchay will \ndiminish.  Therefore, a person should practice satsang solely for the \nkalyãn of his jeev, and should not have any desire whatsoever for any \nmaterial objects. \n \n70.15 “Also, if there are ten members in a household and all ten are faced \nwith death, then is it a small feat if even one is saved?  Or if a person \nwas destined to have to beg for food but received a rotlo to eat \ninstead, is that a small feat?  In these cases, a person should believe \nthat although everything was going to be lost, at least this much has \nbeen saved!  In the same way, even if extreme misery is due to occur, \nthat misery would certainly decrease slightly if a person were to keep \nthe refuge of Bhagvãn.  However, the jeev fails to understand this.  \nAlso, the refuge of Bhagvãn can save a person who is meant to be \nexecuted on a shuli with suffering a mere pinprick. \n \n70.16 “There is a story that illustrates this:  Many thieves lived in a village.  \nOne of the thieves often kept the company of a sãdhu.  Then one day, \nwhile the thief was on his way to visit the sãdhu, a thorn pierced his \nfoot.  As a result, his foot became swollen and he was unable to \naccompany the other thieves in a robbery.  The other thieves, who \nwent to steal, broke into a king’s treasury and escaped with a great \nlarge amount of money, which they shared among themselves.  \nGADHADÃ I \n- 181 - \nNaturally, a lot of money came their way.  On hearing this news, the \nparents, wife, and relatives of the thief who used to sit with the sãdhu \nand who was injured, scolded him:  ‘Because you went to the sãdhu \ninstead of going to steal, we lost out.  The thieves who did go to steal \nreturned with lots of money’.  Meanwhile, the king’s army arrived, \narrested all the thieves, and took them away to be executed on a \nshuli.  The injured thief was also caught and sentenced to execution.  \nHowever, all the villagers and the sãdhu stood witness and said, ‘This \nman was not involved in the theft as he had been hurt by a thorn’.  The \nthief was then released. \n \n70.17 “In the same way, if a person who practices satsang were to face the \nsuffering of being executed on a shuli, it would be reduced to the pain \nof a mere thorn-pick.  After all, I have asked Rãmãnand Swãmi, ‘If \nyour satsangi is destined to suffer the distress inflicted by the sting of \none scorpion, may the distress of the stings of millions and millions of \nscorpions occur at each and every pore of my body, but no pain should \ndistress your satsangi.  Also, if the begging bowl is written in the \nprãrabdha of your satsangi, may that begging bowl come to me, but on \nno account should your satsangi suffer from the lack of food or \nclothing.  Please grant me these two vardãns’.  I asked this of \nRãmãnand Swãmi, and he happily granted it to me.  Therefore, \ndestined worldly miseries, do not fall upon a person practicing \nsatsang.   \n \n70.18 “So, if a person practices satsang with desires for temporary material \nobjects, then doubts will certainly cloud his nishchay.  Therefore, \nother than the desire for the kalyãn of his own jeev, a person should \npractice satsang having no desire whatsoever.  Only then will \nunfaltering nishchay develop.”  \n \n70.19 This is only a portion of the detailed talk delivered by Shreeji \nMahãrãj.   \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 70 || 70 || \nGADHADÃ I \n- 182 -",

    "title": "Bhagvãn Incarnates With His Akshardhãm",
    "content": "Bhagvãn Incarnates With His Akshardhãm \n \n71.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Chaitra vad 4 [2nd April, \n1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting with a large, cylindrical pillow on \na decorated bedstead which had been placed on the platform in front \nof the west-facing medi in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was \nwearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chãdar.  \nHe had also tied a white feto around His head.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as \nwell as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.  \nMuktãnand Swãmi and some sãdhus were singing kirtans to the \naccompaniment of musical instruments. \n \n71.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please conclude the kirtans for now, and \nbegin a question-answer discussion amongst yourselves.” \n \n71.3  Somlã Khãchar then asked, “Bhagvãn forgives all the mistakes of His \nbhaktas, but which one mistake does He not forgive?” \n \n71.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Bhagvãn forgives all other mistakes, but He \ndoes not forgive the mistake of insulting a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  \nTherefore, a person should never harm a bhakta of Bhagvãn in any \nway whatsoever.  Furthermore, of all the mistakes made against \nBhagvãn, to deny the svarup of Bhagvãn is a very serious mistake.  A \nperson should never make this mistake; and anyone who does make \nthis mistake, commits a sin more serious than the five great sins. \n \n71.5 “Denying the svarup of Bhagvãn is nothing more than understanding \nBhagvãn, who eternally is sãkãr, to be nirãkãr.  In fact, Bhagvãn who \nis Purushottam, forever resides with a divya svarup in His \nAkshardhãm, and His divine light is like that of millions of suns and \nmoons.  Countless millions of brahm-rup muktas serve the holy feet \nof that Bhagvãn.  That Bhagvãn, also known as Parbrahm \nPurushottam, incarnates on earth out of compassion, for the kalyãn of \nthe jeevs.  When He incarnates, all tattvas that He accepts become \nGADHADÃ I \n- 183 - \nbrahm.  The three bodies (sthul, sukshma, and kãran), the three \nmental states (jãgrat, svapna, and sushupti), the ten indriyas, and the \nfive prãns, were all apparent in avatãrs such as Rãm and Krishna.  \nAlthough all of them appear to be like ordinary humans, in reality \nthey are all brahm, not mãyik.  Therefore, a person should never deny \nthe svarup of Bhagvãn.” \n \n71.6 Mãtra Dhãdhal then asked, “What is the characteristic of jealousy?” \n \n71.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person who is jealous of someone cannot \ntolerate that person benefiting in any way.  He would be pleased if \nmisery falls upon that person.  That is the characteristic of jealousy.” \n \n71.8 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked the munis, “A person who has nishchay \nin the pratyaksha murti of Bhagvãn, worships Bhagvãn, and behaves \nin accordance with the niyams of satsang, will attain kalyãn.  That is \nthe way of satsang.  However, what are the methods of kalyãn \naccording to the shãstras?  The meanings of the Veds are indeed very \ndifficult to understand, so they are not narrated in kathãs.  However, \nthe Shreemad Bhãgvat Purãn and the Mahãbhãrat contain the \nmessage of the Veds, and are easier to understand.  Therefore, they \nare widely narrated in public kathã.  Please explain how a person can \nattain kalyãn as explained in the shãstras.  Also, bear in mind that \nShankar-Ãchãrya has proposed that Bhagvãn is nirãkãr, whereas \nRãmãnuj-Ãchãrya and other ãchãryas have proposed that Bhagvãn is \nsãkãr.  Therefore, please base your answer on the principles of the \nshãstras.” \n \n71.9 Using references from shãstras, the munis then disproved the view \nthat Bhagvãn is nirãkãr, and promoted the view that kalyãn is only \npossible by the worship of Bhagvãn with a sãkãr murti. \n \n71.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj then commented, “I myself also accept that view, but \nI would like to ask you a question regarding this.  Purushottam \nGADHADÃ I \n- 184 - \nBhagvãn is greater than the nirãkãr Akshar-Brahm and He is \neternally sãkãr.  If a person, who has found that Bhagvãn on this \nearth, still cherishes a desire to see Brahmpur, Golok, Vaikunth, Shvet-\nDvip, and the other dhãms of Bhagvãn, can he be said to have \nnishchay in Bhagvãn, or not?” \n \n71.11 The munis replied, “Despite having found Bhagvãn, a person who \nconstantly feels in his mind, ‘Only when I see Akshardhãm and other \ndhãms, or see the light of millions and millions of suns, is my kalyãn \nattained,’ does not have absolute nishchay.” \n \n71.12 Shreeji Mahãrãj argued this by asking, “What sin has he committed in \nhaving a desire to see Brahmpur, the other dhãms and the svarup of \nbrahm, that you disqualify his nishchay?” \n \n71.13 The munis replied, “Why should a person who believes that kalyãn is \nattained by the mere darshan of pratyaksha Bhagvãn have a dislike \nfor Brahmpur, Golok, and other dhãms?  After all, they do belong to \nBhagvãn.  Also, without Bhagvãn, he would have no desire for them.” \n \n71.14 Shreeji Mahãrãj further questioned, “Those dhãms and the pãrshads \nresiding in them, are chaitanya and are beyond Mãyã.  So, what flaw \nis there in them that a person should not desire to see them?  Also, \nwhat about Bhagvãn who is pratyaksha on this earth?  How do you \nview His pãrshads, who are in fact perishable, and the houses He lives \nin, which can be destroyed?” \n \n71.15 The munis replied, “We understand those houses to be like Brahmpur \nand the other dhãms, and we understand those pãrshads to be \nbrahm-rup.” \n \n71.16 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Brahmpur and the pãrshads of Bhagvãn \nresiding in Brahmpur are immortal and imperishable, whereas the \nhouses and pãrshads of this Mrutyu-Lok are perishable.  How can you \npossibly compare the two?” \nGADHADÃ I \n- 185 - \n71.17 Finally, Nityãnand Swãmi requested, “Mahãrãj, you will have to \nanswer that question.” \n \n71.18 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “When Bhagvãn incarnates for the \npurpose of granting kalyãn to the jeevs, He is always accompanied by \nHis Akshardhãm, His pãrshads – who are chaitanya – and all of His \ndivine powers.  However, they are not perceived by others.  \nNevertheless, when a bhakta acquires an alokik vision during \nsamãdhi, he does see divine light equivalent to countless millions of \nsuns in the murti of Bhagvãn.  Together with the murti, he also sees \ncountless millions of muktas, and also Akshardhãm itself.  Therefore, \nall of these do accompany Bhagvãn.  Despite all of this, Bhagvãn only \naccepts the sevã of His own, earthly bhaktas.  He stays in the houses \nof His bhaktas, which are made of mud, clay, and stone.  He lovingly \naccepts whatever those bhaktas offer Him, whether it is incense, an \noil lamp, food, clothes, or anything else.  He does so for the purpose of \nelevating those earthly pãrshads to the ranks of divya pãrshads.  All \nthe objects that a bhakta offers to Bhagvãn assume a divya form in \nthe dhãm of Bhagvãn.  Moreover, that bhakta also attains a divya \nsvarup and attains those divya objects there.  In this way, Bhagvãn \naccepts all the offerings offered by His earthly bhaktas in order to \nallow them to experience everlasting bliss.  Therefore, a bhakta of \nBhagvãn should realise that the svarup of Bhagvãn, along with His \nAkshardhãm, is present on this earth, and he should also explain this \nfact to others.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 71 || 71 ||",

    "content": "Nishchay Coupled With The Knowledge Of Bhagvãn’s Greatness \n \n72.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Chaitra vad 11 [9th April, 1820], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting facing east on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms near the \nGADHADÃ I \n- 186 - \nmandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, \nas well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n72.2 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi said, “Mahãrãj, yesterday you had a very \nnice talk with Dãdã Khãchar.  All of us very much wish to hear that \ntalk.” \n \n72.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a bhakta of Bhagvãn has nishchay in \nBhagvãn coupled with the knowledge of His greatness, and also \nthoroughly realises the greatness of the sãdhus and satsangis, then \neven if that bhakta’s karmas and kãl happen to be unpleasant, both \nkãl and karma combined are incapable of harming him due to the \nextreme force of his bhakti.  On the other hand, a person lacking \nnishchay in Bhagvãn and His sant, does not benefit in any way, even if \nBhagvãn wishes to do good for that person. \n \n72.4 “A person who suppresses the humble, does not benefit in any way \neither.  In fact, Bhishma-Pitã has said to Yudhishthir Rãjã in the \nMahãbhãrat, ‘If you suppress the humble, you and your descendants \nwill be burnt to ashes’.  Therefore, whether he is a bhakta of Bhagvãn \nor not, no humble person should even slightly be pained.  Moreover, \nif a person does hurt the humble, not only does he not benefit in any \nway, but he also incurs a sin equivalent to the sin of killing a \nbrãhman. \n \n72.5 “In the same way, the sin incurred by making false allegations against \nsomeone is also equivalent to killing a brãhman.  Even if the \nallegations happen to be true, a person should constructively advise \nthe person in private, but in no way should he be publicly humiliated. \n \n72.6 “Similarly, a person who forces the five categories of women to lapse \nin their dharma, also incurs the sin of killing a brãhman.  What are \nthese five categories of women?  First, a woman who has sought a \nperson’s refuge; second, a person’s own wife who does not desire \nintimacy on days of vrat or on day of fasting; third, a woman who is a \nGADHADÃ I \n- 187 - \npati-vratã wife; fourth, a widow; and fifth, a women who has placed \nher trust in a person.  If a person commits adultery with these five \ncategories of women, he incurs the sin of killing a brãhman.  Of these \nfive categories, if a widow’s mind wavers towards immorality, she \nshould be inspired to follow dharma.” \n \n72.7 The munis began to sing rasik kirtans of Bhagvãn.  Hearing them, \nShreeji Mahãrãj said, “When Bhagvãn assumes a body for the sake of \nthe kalyãn of the jeevs, all of His actions are like those of humans.  On \nseeing those actions, a bhakta of Bhagvãn understands them to be \ncharitras, whereas a vimukh or a weak-minded bhakta perceives \navgun.  For example, when Shukji narrated the rãs-leelã, Parikshit \nRãjã had a doubt, and so asked, ‘Bhagvãn had incarnated to establish \nthe order of dharma.  Then, why did he commit a breach of dharma by \nassociating with the wives of others?’  In this way, Parikshit perceived \navgun in Bhagvãn. \n \n72.8 Shukji, on the other hand, thoughtfully began singing praises of \nBhagvãn, explaining that Kãm-Dev has conquered Brahmã and other \ndevs and brought them under his control.  This has greatly inflated \nKãm-Dev’s arrogance.  To vanquish that arrogance, Bhagvãn \nchallenged Kãm-Dev.  Just as a powerful king gives his own weapons \nto his enemy prior to fighting him, Bhagvãn also gave his enemy \n(Kãm-Dev), the necessary ‘ammunition’ for fighting.  What was that \n‘ammunition’?  Well, the force of Kãm-Dev is revealed in the company \nof women, and that force is also greater during the nights of the \nmonsoon season.  In addition, romantic gestures of women, listening \nto seductive words, seeing the beauty of women, and touching \nwomen, greatly increase the force of Kãm-Dev.  After giving all of this \nas ‘ammunition’ to Kãm-Dev, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn conquered Kãm-\nDev and continuously remained an urdhva-retã like a brahm-chãri.  In \nthis way, he vanquished Kãm-Dev’s arrogance.  No one except \nBhagvãn possesses such magnificent powers.  It was after realising \nthis immense power of Bhagvãn that Shukji celebrated the charitras \nGADHADÃ I \n- 188 - \nof Bhagvãn.  However, as Parikshit Rãjã failed to understand this, he \nperceived an avgun in Bhagvãn. \n \n72.9 “However, someone may ask you, ‘Being paramhans, why do you sing \nsuch rasik kirtans?’  In that case, you should tell that person, ‘If we do \nnot sing rasik kirtans, and instead perceive avgun in the rasik charitras \nof Bhagvãn, then we would also join the ranks of Parikshit Rãjã and \nother nãstik vimukhs.  However, we do not wish to join the ranks of \nvimukhs.  After all, Shukji, who is considered to be the guru of all \nparamhans, himself celebrated the rasik charitras of Bhagvãn.  \nTherefore, we must also certainly do the same’. \n \n72.10 “Nevertheless, when Purushottam Bhagvãn, who is greater than both \nthe perishable and the imperishable, assumes a human svarup and \ntravels in the brahmãnd for the kalyãn of the jeevs, His charitras are \njust like those of all humans.  Just as humans possess mãyik svabhãvs \nsuch as kãm, krodh, lobh, moh, mad, matsar, irshyã, ãshã, trushnã, \nabhimãn, defeat, victory, fear, and grief, Bhagvãn also exhibits the \nsame svabhãvs Himself.  However, they are all for the kalyãn of the \njeevs.  So, a true bhakta celebrates the charitras of Bhagvãn and \nattains Akshardhãm, whereas a vimukh perceives avgun in them. \n \n72.11 “In fact, just as Bhagvãn is the ãtmã of the perishable, He is also the \nãtmã of Akshar-Brahm, who is greater than Prakruti and Purush.  \nWith His own powers, Bhagvãn supports both the perishable and the \nimperishable, yet He Himself is distinct from them both.  \nFurthermore, the greatness of Bhagvãn is such that within the pore of \nHis each and every hair, countless millions of brahmãnds appear as \nmere atoms.  Only when that great Bhagvãn becomes like a human \nfor the sake of the kalyãn of the jeevs, do they have an opportunity to \ndo His sevã.  If He were to remain exactly the same size as He really \nis, then even the ruling devs of this brahmãnd, like Brahmã, would be \nincapable of having His darshan and performing His sevã.  Then, what \ncan be said of mere humans? \nGADHADÃ I \n- 189 - \n72.12 “Consider the vadvãnal fire that dwells in the ocean.  Despite \nconsuming the waters of the ocean, it is so vast that even the water of \nthe ocean cannot extinguish it.  If we wished to light an oil lamp in \nour homes and that vadvãnal fire were to enter our homes, instead of \nenjoying the light of the oil lamp, we would all be burnt and reduced \nto ashes.  However, if that same fire were to assume the form of an oil \nlamp, its light would provide joy, even though the oil lamp is the very \nsame fire.  The oil lamp is so weak that it could be easily extinguished \nby blowing on it or smothering it by hand.  Nevertheless, only it can \nprovide comfort to us, whereas the vadvãnal fire cannot. \n \n72.13 “In the same way, Bhagvãn may appear to be as powerless as a \nhuman, but only through that svarup can countless jeevs attain \nkalyãn.  The jeevs are incapable of even doing darshan of His murti, \nwithin who’s each and every hair reside countless millions of \nbrahmãnds.  This makes kalyãn impossible through that murti.  \nTherefore, all charitras Bhagvãn performs after assuming a human \nmurti are worthy of being celebrated.  A person should not doubt, \n‘Despite being Bhagvãn, why does He do this?’  In fact, to realise all of \nBhagvãn’s charitras as kalyãn-kãri, is the very dharma of a bhakta.  \nOnly a person who understands this can be called a perfect bhakta of \nBhagvãn.” \n \n72.14 Kãkã-Bhãi, of the village Rojkã, then asked, “What are the \ncharacteristics of a person who merely has nishchay in Bhagvãn, \nwithout realising His greatness?  Also, what are the characteristics of \nperson who has nishchay in Bhagvãn coupled with the knowledge of \nHis greatness?” \n \n72.15 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person with only nishchay still has the \ndoubt, ‘Although I have attained Bhagvãn, will I attain kalyãn or not?’  \nOn the other hand, a person with nishchay coupled with the \nknowledge of Bhagvãn’s greatness believes, ‘From the very day I had \nthe darshan of Bhagvãn, my kalyãn has been guaranteed.  In fact, \nGADHADÃ I \n- 190 - \nkalyãn is also assured to anyone who devoutly has my darshan or \naccepts my advice.  Then, how can there be any doubt regarding my \nown kalyãn?  I am indeed absolutely fulfilled.  Furthermore, whichever \nspiritual activity I do perform, I perform solely to please Bhagvãn’.  A \nperson with such understanding should be known to have nishchay \nin Bhagvãn coupled with the knowledge of His greatness.” \n \n72.16 Again, Kãkã-Bhãi asked, “What are the characteristics of the three \ntypes of bhaktas of Bhagvãn –uttam, madhyam, and kanishth?” \n \n72.17 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The uttam bhakta believes himself to be the \nãtmã, and distinct from his body.  He does not associate the qualities \nof the body (jad, full of misery, perishable, impure) with the ãtmã, \nand nor does he associate the qualities of the ãtmã (achhedhya, \nabhedhya, avinãshi) with the body.  He sees the jeevãtmã residing in \nhis body, as well as the Paramãtmã dwelling within his ãtmã.  Not \nonly that, he sees the ãtmãs residing in the bodies of the others as \nwell.  Despite having become so skilled, he realises Bhagvãn and His \nsant to be superior to ãtmã-nishthã, and does not have even the \nslightest pride in the fact that he has attained ãtmã-nishthã.  A person \nwith such characteristics is said to be an uttam bhakta. \n \n72.18 “In comparison, a person who becomes jealous of bhaktas of \nBhagvãn, despite having knowledge of the ãtmã and nishchay in \nBhagvãn, should be considered to be madhyam bhakta.  If Bhagvãn \nwere to insult this person, he develops jealousy towards Bhagvãn, \nand feels, ‘Even though Bhagvãn is so great, why is He treating me this \nway, despite no fault of my own?’  \n \n72.19 “Finally, a person who has nishchay in Bhagvãn but no ãtmã-nishthã, \nhas love for Bhagvãn as well as for the affairs of this world, and \nexperiences joy and grief in the affairs of this world, should be \nconsidered to be a kanishth bhakta.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 72 || 72 || \nGADHADÃ I \n- 191 -",

    "title": "Conquering Lust",
    "content": "Conquering Lust \nThe World’s Greatest Brahm-Chãri \n \n73.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the night of Chaitra vad Amãs [12th April, \n1820], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda \noutside the north-facing room of His residence in Dãdã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes and had covered \nHimself with a white chãdar.  He had also tied a white feto around His \nhead.  At that time, four senior sãdhus, including Muktãnand Swãmi, \nand some fifty other haribhaktas, had gathered before Him. \n \n73.2 Then, Gopãlãnand Swãmi asked, “What is the nature of lust?” \n \n73.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “Semen alone is the nature of lust.” \n \n73.4 Gopãlãnand Swãmi then raised a doubt, “Semen is one of the seven \nbasic constituents of the body – the seven basic constituents of the \nbody are: ras (bodily fluids), rakta (blood), mãns (muscle), med (fat), \nasthi (bones), majjã (marrow), and shukra (semen).  Then, how can \nsemen alone be called the nature of lust?  Also, how exactly is that \nsemen produced?” \n \n73.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The mind resides in the mano-vahã nãdi.  \nWhenever a thought related to women arises in the mind, semen is \nchurned from the body, and after collecting in the mano-vahã nãdi, it \nis discharged through the genitals – just as ghee surfaces from \nyoghurt when it is churned by a churning rod.  A person whose semen \nis not discharged through the genitals is known as an urdhva-retã \nand a perfect brahm-chãri.  When Shree Krishna Bhagvãn associated \nwith the gopis during the rãs-leelã, he did not allow the discharge of \nsemen.  For this reason, he was known as an urdhva-retã brahm-\nchãri, and had therefore conquered lust.  Therefore, semen alone is \nthe nature of lust.  A person who has conquered semen, has \nconquered lust.” \nGADHADÃ I \n- 192 - \n73.6 Gopãlãnand Swãmi asked again, “When the body is burnt after death, \nits seven constituents are burnt along with it.  Therefore, if semen \nalone is the nature of lust, then by the burning of semen along with \nthe body, lust should also be burnt.  Why then, does lust arise when \nthe jeev enters another body?” \n \n73.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Semen is retained in the sukshma body.  \nMoreover, it is because of the sukshma body that the sthul body is \nproduced.  When a ghost, which is mainly composed of a sukshma \nbody, enters into the sthul body of another man and associates with a \nwoman, that woman conceives a child by that ghost.  Therefore, \nsemen is definitely retained in the sukshma body.” \n \n73.8 Gopãlãnand Swãmi questioned further, “Shivji was an urdhva-retã, \nyet on seeing Mohini, semen was discharged.  This implies that as \nlong as there is semen in the body, it is sure to be discharged \nwhenever a man associates with a woman in the jãgrat state or \nsvapna state.  So then, as long as there is semen in the body, how can \na person be called a perfect brahm-chãri?” \n \n73.9 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “That can be said to be a fault in Shivji’s \nyogic powers.  A person whose semen is discharged in the jãgrat \nstate or svapna state by the thought of a woman, cannot be called a \ntrue brahm-chãri.  That is why in this whole world, Nar-Nãrãyan \nRushi is the only one who has firm brahm-chãrya.  Since we have \naccepted the refuge of that Nar-Nãrãyan Rushi, by his grace and by \nworshipping him, we shall also gradually become nishkãmi and \nperfect brahm-chãris like Him. \n \n73.10 “Yogis try to burn the semen, which remains in the body, with great \neffort.  However, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn maintained perfect brahm-\nchãrya, even in the midst of the company of women.  Such powers are \nonly present in Bhagvãn.  No one else is capable of remaining \nuninfluenced in this way.  Therefore, other yogis should make an \nGADHADÃ I \n- 193 - \neffort to avoid thinking of women in both the jãgrat state and the \nsvapna state.” \n \n73.11 Shuk Muni then asked, “In Dvãrikã, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn had \n16,108 wives.  It is said that He had ten sons and one daughter by \neach wife.  How should one understand this?” \n \n73.12 Shreeji Mahãrãj clarified, “The incidents of Dvãrikã are one thing, and \nthen incidents of Vraj are another.  In Dvãrikã, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn \nhad adopted the philosophy of Sãnkhya.  A follower of the Sãnkhya \nphilosophy believes his own self to be distinct from the mind, body, \nand indriyas.  While performing all actions, he does not regard \nhimself as being the doer of those actions, nor does he experience \neither joy or grief from those actions.  That was the principle adopted \nby Shree Krishna Bhagvãn.  Therefore, He was said to be \nuninfluenced.  The Sãnkhya philosophy adopted by Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn in Dvãrikã is the very same Sãnkhya philosophy followed by \nkings such as Janak, who worshipped Bhagvãn as grahasthas.  In the \nsame way, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn was also a grahastha, and was \nknown as the king of Dvãrikã.  Therefore, because He followed the \nSãnkhya philosophy, he remained uninfluenced as well. \n \n73.13 “However, in Vrundãvan Shree Krishna Bhagvãn had adopted the \nphilosophy of Yog, by which He maintained His vow of perfect \nbrahm-chãrya, despite associating with women.  At that time, He \ndisplayed the powers of Nar-Nãrãyan Rushi within Himself.  In the \nShreemad Bhãgvat, Kapil-Dev explains to Devhuti, ‘No one, except \nNar-Nãrãyan Rushi, is capable of overcoming my mãyã in the form of \nwomen’.  However, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn conquered lust while \nassociating with women. \n \n73.14 “Now, consider the following incident: When Durvãsã Rushi came \nand Shree Krishna Bhagvãn began sending all the gopis with dishes \nGADHADÃ I \n- 194 - \nfilled with food for him, the gopis asked, ‘How shall we cross the \nYamunãji River?’ \n \n73.15 “At that time, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn said, ‘Tell Yamunãji that if Shree \nKrishna is forever a brahm-chãri, then make way for us’.  When the \ngopis said this to Yamunãji, she made way for them. \n \n73.16 “After feeding Durvãsã Rushi, all the gopis asked him, ‘Yamunãji is in \nour way.  How shall we return home?’ \n \n73.17 “Durvãsã Rushi then asked, ‘How did you come?’ \n \n73.18 “The gopis explained, ‘We told Yamunãji that if Shree Krishna is \nforever a brahm-chãri, then make way for us.  So she made way for us.  \nBut how shall we return home now?’ \n \n73.19 “Durvãsã Rushi then said, ‘Tell Yamunãji that if Durvãsã Rushi is \nforever fasting, then make way for us’.  When the gopis said this to \nYamunãji, she made way for them.  Seeing this, the gopis were \nextremely surprised.  However, they were unable to realise the \ngreatness of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn or Durvãsã Rushi. \n \n73.20 “Shree Krishna Bhagvãn played with the gopis while maintaining His \nvow of perfect brahm-chãrya and was therefore still a brahm-chãri.  \nDurvãsã Rushi also united his ãtmã with Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, the \nãtmã of all, and although he ate all the food offered by the gopis, he \nwas still forever fasting.  This was because in reality, he had fed all \nthe food to Bhagvãn.  Therefore, the actions of the extremely great \ncannot be understood. \n \n73.21 “If a person looks for followers of the Sãnkhya philosophy, he could \nfind thousands.  However, to be an urdhva-retã by way of yogic \npowers, is only possible for Nar-Nãrãyan.  In addition, a true bhakta \nof Nar-Nãrãyan can also gradually develop firm brahm-chãrya by the \npower of his worship, but others cannot. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 195 - \n73.22 “Furthermore, if semen is discharged through the genitals in the \njãgrat state or svapna state, a person cannot be called a brahm-chãri.  \nNevertheless, a person who follows the eight types of tyãg of women \nis walking on the path of brahm-chãrya.  So with time, by the grace of \nNar-Nãrãyan, he will gradually become a firm brahm-chãri. \n \n73.23 “When I was young, I had heard that semen is also released through a \nperson’s sweat.  So in order to retain my semen, I learnt two types of \njal-basti, and also kunjar-kriyã.  In order to conquer lust, I learnt \nmany yogic ãsans as well.  When I slept at night, I slept in the posture \nof gorakh-ãsan to prevent the discharge of semen even in the svapna \nstate.  To conquer lust, I made such an effort that my body stopped \nsweating, and I no longer felt either the cold or the heat.  Then, when \nI came to Rãmãnand Swãmi, he tried to make me sweat by pasting \nãval leaves all over my body.  Even then, my body would not sweat.  \nTherefore, conquering lust is the most difficult of all spiritual \nactivities.  However, a person who has the firm strength of upãsanã of \nBhagvãn’s svarup, has become absolutely free from desires for the \nfive vishays, and is firm in remaining free of worldly desires, becomes \nfree of lust by the grace of Bhagvãn.” \n \n73.24 Nityãnand Swãmi then asked, “What is the method of becoming free \nof worldly desires?  Is it listening to talks, or is it vairãgya?” \n \n73.25 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Vairãgya alone cannot last; it is eventually \ndestroyed.  Therefore, after developing knowledge of the ãtmã and \ncomplete gnãn of Bhagvãn’s svarup, a person should think, ‘I am the \nãtmã and sachidãnand, whereas the body and the brahmãnd are mãyik \nand perishable.  How can they compare to me?  Moreover, my ishta-dev \nis Purushottam Bhagvãn, who is greater than even Akshar, and is the \nsupporter of countless millions of brahmãnds.  I have the firm refuge of \nthat Bhagvãn’.  Vairãgya developed from these thoughts, is said to be \ncoupled with gnãn.  It is this vairãgya that is never destroyed.  For \nexample, a burning flame is extinguished when water is poured over \nit.  However, the vadvãnal fire, which rests in the ocean, cannot be \nGADHADÃ I \n- 196 - \nextinguished even by the waters of the ocean itself.  Similarly, \nvairãgya coupled with gnãn is like the vadvãnal fire and the fire of \nlightning – it cannot be extinguished.  Without that gnãn, other forms \nof vairãgya cannot be trusted. \n \n73.26 “My vairãgya is like that of the fire of lightning and the vadvãnal fire.  \nThis nature of mine is known by those who have stayed extremely \nclose to me.  However, those who remain far from me, are unable to \nrealise my nature.  Furthermore, this Mulji Brahm-Chãri may appear \nto be naïve, yet he thoroughly knows my nature, and understands, \n‘Mahãrãj is as distant as ãkãsh.  He has no prejudices against or in \nfavour of anyone’.  Also, because he knows my nature, he possesses \nqualities like those of Bhagvãn.  Moreover, the antaryãmi Bhagvãn \nresiding within all, explains to the minds of all men and women, \n‘There is no fault whatsoever in this Brahm-Chari’. \n \n73.27 “The means of acquiring such great qualities is as follows:  Whoever \nbelieves a great sant to be absolutely free of flaws becomes totally \nflawless himself.  However, if a person perceives flaws in a great sant, \nthat person’s intellect becomes polluted, and inner enemies, like kãm \nand krodh, all come to dwell within his heart.  As a result, the heart of \nthat person who perceives faults in the sat-purush is greatly troubled \nby disturbing thoughts.  Although he may practice satsang, he never \nstops being unhappy. \n \n73.28 “Those who are wise, realise all my characteristics by staying close to \nme.  They realise, ‘Mahãrãj has no affection for any object in this world \nthat can awaken infatuation, such as wealth, women, jewellery, food, \nand drink.  In fact, Mahãrãj remains distant from all these things.  Also, \nwhen He allows someone to sit near Him or talks to him of gnãn, it is \npurely out of compassion for the kalyãn of the jeev’.  On the other hand, \nthose who are fools, whether they stay near or far, cannot \nunderstand my nature. \n73.29 “These talks can only be understood by a person who has ãtmã-\nnishthã, who offers bhakti to Bhagvãn while holding His murti within \nGADHADÃ I \n- 197 - \nthe ãtmã, and who does not abandon the worship of Bhagvãn even \nafter becoming brahm-rup.  Therefore, after developing ãtmã-nishthã \nand understanding the greatness of Bhagvãn’s murti, no desire for \nany objects remains.  Once worldly desires are eradicated, a person \nmay experience pain and pleasure according to the prãrabdha of his \nbody, but the indriyas no longer remain sharp. \n \n73.30 “The indriyas are the jagged edges of the manomay chakra.  They \nbecome blunt only by the complete understanding of brahm and \nParbrahm.  For example, if a person, whose teeth have become very \nsensitive as a result of sucking lemons, has to chew some chick-peas, \nhe would never be able to chew them.  If he was extremely hungry, he \nwould at most swallow them, but he would be unable to chew them.  \nSimilarly, a person who has thoroughly understood the greatness of \nBhagvãn and the ãtmã, feels no joy whatsoever in any of the \npleasures of the vishays of any dhãm.  While the prãrabdha of the \nbody continues, he may indulge in food, drink, and other objects, but \nhe would do so in the same way as the person with sensitised teeth, \nswallowing whole chick-peas. \n \n73.31 “To eradicate worldly desires is indeed an extremely difficult task.  In \nfact, they remain even after mastering samãdhi.  After attaining \nsamãdhi, there is no way a person can return back into his body from \nthe svarup of brahm.  If he does return, it is because of one of three \nreasons.  Firstly, he returns to his body from samãdhi if he holds \ndesires for worldly pleasures.  Secondly, if someone is extremely \npowerful, he can enter into samãdhi and return to the body according \nto his own will.  Lastly, if there is another person who is much more \npowerful, then that person can bring someone back into their body \nfrom samãdhi.  These are the three ways of returning to the body \nfrom samãdhi. \n \n73.32 “When samãdhi occurs, a person has the darshan of Brahm and sees \nthe divine light of Brahm to be like that of countless millions of suns.  \nAt that time, if that person does not have much understanding, he \nGADHADÃ I \n- 198 - \nregards the murti of pratyaksha Purushottam Bhagvãn to be inferior, \nand believes Brahm to be superior.  This leads to committing a \nbreach of upãsanã.  That is why firm nishchay should be developed in \nthe pratyaksha murti, because only then can all things be \naccomplished.  I am also determined that I shall not allow any flaw \nwhatsoever to remain in anyone who sincerely surrenders his mind \nto me.  Therefore, I shall not allow even a little distance to remain \nbetween us.” \n \n73.33 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “What are the characteristics of a \nperson who has surrendered his mind, and what are the \ncharacteristics of a person who has not surrendered his mind?” \n \n73.34 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a person, who has surrendered his mind \nto Bhagvãn, is unable to be present while the talks of Bhagvãn are \ngoing on, or for the darshan of Bhagvãn, he experiences intense \nregret in his heart.  Whenever he listens to the talks of Bhagvãn and \nhas the darshan of Bhagvãn, his love for Bhagvãn continually \nincreases, but never does his mind recede from those talks and \ndarshan.  Moreover, when Bhagvãn gives an ãgnã to someone to stay \nfar away, a person who has surrendered his mind would think to \nhimself, ‘If that ãgnã was given to me, I would gladly go to Buranpur or \nKãshi, or anywhere else for that matter’.  A person, who remains \nhappy living according to the wishes of Bhagvãn in this way, is near \nto me; even if he is a thousand miles away. \n \n73.35 “On the other hand, a person who has not surrendered his mind in \nthis way, is as good as being hundreds of thousands of miles away, \neven though he may be staying very close to me.  In fact, I am afraid \nof even giving advice to a person who has not surrendered his mind \nto me, as I fear ‘Will he accept it positively or negatively?’  These are \nthe characteristics of a person who has surrendered his mind and \nwho has not surrendered his mind.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 73 || 73 || \nGADHADÃ I \n- 199 -",

    "content": "Satsang Flourishes Or Declines By The Wish Of Nar-Nãrãyan \n \n74.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the morning of Vaishãkh sud 11 [24th \nApril, 1820], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a \ndecorated bedstead under the neem tree opposite the mandir of \nShree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan, in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n74.2  Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The extent of a person’s vairãgya and \nunderstanding, can be measured only when he encounters vishays, or \nin times of hardship, but not otherwise.  That being so, what can be \nsaid about situations of extreme happiness or hardship?  For \nexample, everyone must have realised the state of their own antah-\nkarans during the minor difficulty that recently fell upon Dãdã \nKhãchar.” \n \n74.3 Muktãnand Swãmi then said, “It is natural that in a person’s heart, he \nsides with Bhagvãn’s bhaktas, with the understanding that if satsang \nflourishes, many people will benefit; but if the satsang suffers a \nsetback in any way, no one will benefit.  That is why joy and grief are \nexperienced.” \n \n74.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Since we are the dãs of Nar-Nãrãyan, we \nshould be pleased with whatever pleases Him.  If it is the wish of Nar-\nNãrãyan, then our satsang will flourish; and if He wishes to make it \ndecrease, then it will decrease.  Also, if Nar-Nãrãyan seats us on an \nelephant, we should be happy; and if He seats us on a donkey, then \nwe should also remain happy.  We should not have the slightest love \nfor anything except the holy feet of Nar-Nãrãyan.  If there is a person \nwho’s mind is attached to just a minor responsibility, then what will \nbecome of him if he is given the major responsibility of taking care of \nthe whole world? \nGADHADÃ I \n- 200 - \n74.5 “For this reason, our lord, Shree Nar-Nãrãyan, performs tap while \nsitting under a bordi tree; and He does not touch anything that gives \nworldly pleasures.  That is why we are the dãs of our lord, Shree Nar-\nNãrãyan.  Just as a pati-vratã wife keeps jewellery, clothes, and food, \nless than her husband, we should keep less worldly pleasures than \nour Shree Nar-Nãrãyan.  \n \n74.6 “If a bhakta wishes great things for Bhagvãn, it is fine if he has these \nwishes while doing bhakti, and if he is nishkãmi.  The bhakta should \nnot wish these objects for himself.  Bhagvãn is not at all interested in \nthe enjoyment of these worldly objects for Himself, but He sees the \nbhakti of the bhakta, and accepts the objects given by them.  \n \n74.7 “Bhagvãn is the master of millions of universes, and the master of \nBrahmpur, Golok, and Vaikunth, and other dhãms, and the master of \nRãdhikãji and Lakshmiji.  If Bhagvãn desired worldly objects and \nenjoyments, why would He abandon all these things and sit under a \nbordi tree to perform tap?  Therefore, Bhagvãn can have no desire for \nworldly pleasures.  In comparison to other avatãrs, our Nar-Nãrãyan \nis a greater tyãgi, and performs tap for the kalyãn of jeevs. \n \n74.8 “If Nar-Nãrãyan has desires for worldly objects, then why does He eat \nberries and sit under a tree?  There are many foolish souls in the \nworld who are owners of land.  If Nar-Nãrãyan, who is Bhagvãn, \nwanted some wealth and worldly pleasures, then should He not keep \nat least a few villages for His own use?  However, Bhagvãn does not \nwant anything.  Therefore, we should become a greater tyãgi than \nour master.  \n \n74.9 “In whatever way satsang flourishes by the wish of Bhagvãn, we \nshould remain joyful.  If it is the wish of Bhagvãn, then the whole \nworld will become satsangis; or if He so wishes, then satsang will \ndecline.  But, under no condition, should we have grief of joy in our \nminds.  Whatever occurs is due to the actions of Bhagvãn.  So, just as \nGADHADÃ I \n- 201 - \na dry leaf blows in the air according to the direction of the wind, we \nshould remain with Bhagvãn and worship him, and never let any \nunhappiness enter our minds.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 74 || 74 ||",

    "content": "Redeeming Seventy-One Generations \n \n75.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Vaishãkh vad 11 [8th May, 1820], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead \nunder the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan \nin Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a garland of \nyellow flowers around His neck, and was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n75.2 Surã Khãchar then asked, “It is said that seventy-one generations of a \nfamily, which consists of a bhakta of Bhagvãn, attain kalyãn.  But, \nmany in that family may even be enemies of Bhagvãn and His sant.  In \nwhat way do they attain kalyãn?” \n \n75.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “Devhuti had profound love towards \nKardam Rushi as her husband, yet she attained kalyãn because of her \nlove for him.  The fifty daughters of Mandhãtã Rãjã who married \nSaubhari Rushi, were attracted to him because of his handsome \nappearance.  Although their love for Saubhari was born out of lust, \nthey still all attained kalyãn like Saubhari Rushi himself.  Therefore, if \nall the members of a family, in which there is a bhakta, believe ‘We \nare indeed very fortunate to have a bhakta of Bhagvãn in our family’, \nand keep love for the bhakta with such an understanding of his \ngreatness, then all the members of the family will attain kalyãn.  Even \nif the bhakta’s ancestors, who have died and have gone to Svarg, \nrealise ‘We are indeed very fortunate to have a bhakta of Bhagvãn in \nGADHADÃ I \n- 202 - \nour family’, and they also keep love for the bhakta, then those \nancestors will attain kalyãn as well. \n \n75.4 “However, a person who keeps hatred towards a bhakta of Bhagvãn, \ndoes not attain kalyãn.  As his hatred towards the bhakta increases, \nhis mind becomes more and more polluted.  In fact, when he dies, he \nfalls into the same pit of Narak as that entered by a person who has \ncommitted the five great sins.  Therefore, all those who have love for \na bhakta of Bhagvãn, regardless of whether they are family members \nor not, attain kalyãn.” \n \n75.5 Then, Nãjã Bhakta asked, “Suppose there is one bhakta of Bhagvãn \nwith firm nishchay, and another with only a little nishchay.  Although \noutwardly they both appear to be good, how can the two be \nrecognised?” \n \n75.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “A person who has precise gnãn of the \nnature of the ãtmã, firm vairãgya, and perfect bhakti and svadharma, \nshould be known to have perfect nishchay.  Even if one of these four \nfactors is lacking, then despite having nishchay, it is still without the \nknowledge of Bhagvãn’s greatness.  If all four factors are totally \npresent, then that should be known as nishchay in Bhagvãn coupled \nwith the knowledge of His greatness.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 75 || 75 ||",

    "content": "A Person With Krodh, Irshyã, Kapat, And Mãn \n \n76.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on sud 11 of the first Jyeshth [23rd May, \n1820], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was seated in His \nresidence in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  At that time, some senior sãdhus were \nseated before Him. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 203 - \n76.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “There are four types of people I do not get \nalong with, even if they happen to be bhaktas of Bhagvãn:  A person \nwith krodh, a person with irshyã, a person with kapat, and a person \nwith abhimãn.  Of these, both krodh and irshyã are dependent on \nabhimãn.  Furthermore, I can never believe a person with kãm to be a \nsatsangi.  In fact, even if such a person happens to be in satsang, he is \nas good as a vimukh. \n \n76.3  “A true satsangi is a person who has absolutely no flaws in following \nthe panch-vartmãn, and who remains totally undisturbed until the \nend of his life, regardless of whatever strict commands I may impose, \nand force him to abandon his preferences and enforce my own.  I \neffortlessly and naturally develop love for such a bhakta.  On the \nother hand, I cannot develop love for a bhakta without these \nqualities, even if I try.  This is because my nature is such that I can \nonly develop love for a person who possesses perfect bhakti for \nBhagvãn in his heart.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 76 || 76 ||",

    "content": "Not Invalidating Dharma Under The Excuse Of Gnãn \n \n77.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on vad Amãs of the second Jyeshth [10th July, \n1820], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms in front of \nthe mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, \nas well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n77.2 In the sabhã, the munis were engaged in a question-answer \ndiscussion amongst themselves.  During the discussion, a muni, out of \nmisunderstanding, began to invalidate dharma on the basis of his \nnishchay in Bhagvãn. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 204 - \n 77.3 Hearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj commented, “A person who abandons \ndharma under the excuse of the gnãn of Bhagvãn, should be \nconsidered to be demonic.  The svarup of Bhagvãn possesses \ncountless kalyãn-kãri qualities, which Pruthvi has described to \nDharma in the first skandh of the Shreemad Bhãgvat.  Therefore, a \nperson who has accepted the refuge of Bhagvãn acquires these \nkalyãn-kãri qualities.  Moreover, a person who has nishchay in \nBhagvãn also acquires the thirty characteristics of a sãdhu described \nin the eleventh skandh of the Shreemad Bhãgvat.  Therefore, a person \nwho does not possess the thirty characteristics of a sãdhu should not \nbe considered to be a true sãdhu.   \n \n77.4 “Conversely, a person who does have nishchay in Bhagvãn definitely \ndoes acquire the kalyãn-kãri qualities of Bhagvãn within his heart.  \nWhen these qualities of Bhagvãn are acquired by a sãdhu, he also \nacquires the thirty characteristics of a sãdhu.  From today onwards, \nwhoever abandons dharma (panch-vartmãn), and solely supports the \nstrength of bhakti or gnãn, is a blasphemer of the guru and guru’s \nword.  Anyone who even talks of such a lapse in dharma should be \ncalled a vimukh and told, ‘You have sided with demons, and we shall \nnot accept it’.  With such words, the talks of that sinful person should \nbe dismissed.” \n \n77.5 A sant then asked, “Mahãrãj, there may be an extremely faithful \nbhakta of Bhagvãn who suffers great pain and who babbles \nmeaninglessly at the time of death, whereas a person who does not \nseem to be a true bhakta appears extremely composed at the time of \nhis death.  In fact, he dies in comfort, realising the glory of Bhagvãn, \nand even expressing His greatness.  What is the reason behind this?  \nPlease explain why a religious person’s death appears to be \nunpleasant in comparison to an ordinary person’s death that appears \nto be pleasant?” \n \n77.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “A person’s mind is influenced by the \neight factors of desh, kãl, kriyã, sang, dhyãn, mantra, dikshã, and \nGADHADÃ I \n- 205 - \nshãstra.  If these eight factors are pure, the mind becomes pure; but, \nif they are impure, the mind becomes impure.  \n \n77.7 “Also, Bhagvãn’s mãyã inspires the dharmas of the four yugs to \nprevail in turn within a person’s heart.  At the time of death, if the \ndharma of Satya-Yug is prevalent, then death appears very pleasant.  \nIf the dharma of either Tretã-Yug or Dvãpar-Yug is prevalent, then \ndeath appears less pleasant.  However, when the dharma of Kali-Yug \nis prevalent, death appears extremely unpleasant.  In this way, the \npleasantness and unpleasantness of death is also determined by kãl. \n \n77.8 “The three mental states – jãgrat, svapna, and sushupti – are also \nfactors.  At the time of death, if the jãgrat state is prevalent, then even \na sinner would die while still completely conscious.  If the svapna \nstate is prevalent at the time of death, then a person dies mumbling \nwithout making sense, even if he is a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  \nFurthermore, if the sushupti state is prevalent at the time of death, \nthen regardless of whether a person is a bhakta of Bhagvãn or a \nvimukh, he passes away unconsciously, unable to say anything, \nneither good nor bad.  However, if a person dies while thoroughly \nrealising his jeevãtmã as greater than these three states and as being \nbrahm-rup, he passes away displaying all the powers of Bhagvãn.  \nPassing away after becoming brahm-rup and displaying such powers, \nis only possible for bhaktas of Bhagvãn.  It is not possible for any \nvimukh.  In this way, Kãl, as well as the three mental states, \ndetermines the pleasantness and unpleasantness present at the time \nof death.   \n \n77.9 “However, even if a vimukh dies speaking normally, with the jãgrat \nstate being prevalent, that does not imply in any way that he will \nattain kalyãn.  Regardless of whether he dies pleasantly or \nunpleasantly, he will go only to Narak.  Conversely, regardless of \nwhether a bhakta of Bhagvãn speaks normally, babbles without \nmaking sense, or remains silent at the time of death, he definitely \nattains kalyãn.  There is no doubt whatsoever in this fact.  All bhaktas \nGADHADÃ I \n- 206 - \nof Bhagvãn should realise this.  Although a bhakta of Bhagvãn \nappears to be suffering pain when passing away, he actually \nexperiences great bliss within due to the grace of Bhagvãn.  So, even \nif at the time of his death a bhakta passes away babbling without \nmaking sense, there should be no doubts at all regarding his kalyãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 77 || 77||",

    "content": "The Affect Of Desh, Kãl, Kriyã, And Sang \n \n78.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Ashãdh sud 3 [13th July, 1820], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda outside the \nwest-facing rooms in front of the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in \nDãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes, \nand had covered Himself with a white chãdar.  He was also wearing a \nwhite pãgh on His head and a garland of white flowers around His \nneck.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n78.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “All sant, please listen.  I wish to ask a \nquestion.” \n \n78.3 The sants responded, “Please ask, Mahãrãj.” \n \n \n \n78.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “If the eight influences of desh, kãl, kriyã, sang, \nmantra, dhyãn, dikshã, and shãstras are pleasant, they purify a \nperson’s mind.  However, if these eight influences are unpleasant, \nthey pollute a person’s mind.  But, do the sanskãrs of the karmas \nperformed in past lives have any influence on these eight factors?” \n \n78.5 The munis answered, “It seems that the karmas of past lives do play a \nrole.  If a person’s past karmas are pleasant, he is born in a pleasant \ndesh.  However, if the past karmas are unpleasant, he is born in an \nGADHADÃ I \n- 207 - \nunpleasant desh.  In the same way, the other seven factors are also \ndetermined by past karmas.  Therefore, past karmas appear to play a \nmajor role in all of them.  The eight influences may be predominant \nin certain circumstances, but past karmas are predominant in all \ncircumstances.” \n \n78.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj then questioned, “From what principle in the \nshãstras do you claim that past karmas play the predominant role \namong all the eight influences?  Please quote any reference from the \nshãstras.  After all, only in the Jain shãstras, and not in any other, does \na person find the predominance of only karmas.  Other shãstras \nexplain only the predominance of the sang of Bhagvãn and His \nbhaktas.  Moreover, because you support the predominance of only \npast karmas, are you truly nãstiks superficially disguised as satsangis, \nor what?  This is because no one except the nãstiks promote the \npredominance of karmas.  They believe the Veds, the shãstras, the \nPurãns, and the Mahãbhãrat, and other historical shãstras, to be false.  \nThey only accept their own shãstras, written in the Mãgdhi dialect, as \nauthentic.  Therefore, it is only out of foolishness that they only \npromote past karmas. \n \n78.7 “If the eight influences vary according to past karmas, then why has \nthe hundred-feet-deep underground water not risen to the surface \nfor the many religious kings who have been born in the region of \nMarvad?  If the influence of desh was controlled by past karmas, then \nthe water-table should rise for people who have performed good \ndeeds, and fall for sinners.  However, this is not the case, because in \nthe region of Marvad, both sinners and religious people suffer from \nthe problem of water being found deep underground.  In reality, each \ndesh does not lose its natural characteristics.  Therefore, the eight \ninfluences do not vary according to past karmas. \n \n78.8 “Therefore, a person who desires his own kalyãn should not uphold \nthe predominance of karmas in the way that nãstiks do.  If the eight \nGADHADÃ I \n- 208 - \ninfluences are unpleasant, he should abandon them and seek only \npleasant influences. \n \n78.9 “Moreover, just as pleasant and unpleasant desh exist outside the \nbody, a person’s body can also be a pleasant or unpleasant desh.  If \nthe desh (the body) is pleasant when the jeev resides within it, then \nkalyãn-kãri qualities such as nobility, contentment, compassion, and \ndharma, develop.  However, if the desh (the body) is unpleasant when \nthe jeev resides within it, then flaws such as kãm, krodh, lobh, moh, \nmad, and matsar develop instead. \n \n78.10 “Also, pleasant and unpleasant sang should be distinguished as \nfollows:  When no distance remains between a person and the sang \nhe keeps, this is known as true sang.  Outwardly, even enemies \nembrace each other, yet their hearts are hundreds of thousands of \nmiles apart.  Such outward sang cannot be called sang.  Only sang that \nis kept by thought, word, and deed, can be called sang.  A person \nshould keep such sang – by thought, word, and deed – only with \nBhagvãn or His bhaktas, as it leads to the kalyãn of a person’s jeev.  \nHowever, a person should never keep the sang of a sinner.” \n \n78.11 Then, at midday, Shreeji Mahãrãj called all the young, student sãdhus \nand requested, “All of you student sãdhus, please ask me questions.” \n \n78.12 Motã Shivãnand Swãmi then asked, “How can a person who has firm \nnishchay in Bhagvãn, be recognised?” \n \n78.13 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person with firm nishchay in Bhagvãn \nregards all actions performed by Bhagvãn as kalyãn-kãri, whether \nthey are good or bad.  In fact, however many countless kinds of kriyã \na faithful bhakta witnesses, whether Bhagvãn wins or loses or runs \naway, or whether He shows pleasure or grief, he says, ‘All kriyãs of \nBhagvãn are for the sake of kalyãn’.  If a bhakta speaks only in this \nway whenever he speaks, then he should be known to have absolute \nnishchay in Bhagvãn.” \nGADHADÃ I \n- 209 - \n78.14 Then, Nirmanãnand Swãmi asked, “How can a person prevent the \ndevelopment of a fault-finding attitude towards Bhagvãn and His \nsãdhus?” \n \n78.15 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “If a person possesses the previously \nmentioned firm nishchay in Bhagvãn, then he never develops a fault-\nfinding attitude towards Bhagvãn.  Furthermore, when he thinks of \nthe greatness of the dãs of such a great Bhagvãn, he never perceives \nfaults in the bhaktas of Bhagvãn either.” \n \n78.16 Then, Nirmanãnand Swãmi and Nãnã Pragnãnand Swãmi both asked, \n“How can a person see the murti of Bhagvãn in all the three mental \nstates of jãgrat, svapna, and sushupti?” \n \n78.17 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If the pure sanskãrs from a person’s \nprevious lives are powerful, then he can constantly see the murti of \nBhagvãn in all three states.  If a person, who continuously \nexperiences fear, lust, or love for something, can see objects other \nthan Bhagvãn constantly in all three states, then what is surprising \nabout being able to see Bhagvãn constantly as well?  He can definitely \nbe seen.” \n \n78.18 Nãnã Shivãnand Swãmi then asked, “How can a person with a stable \nfoundation in satsang be recognised?  That is the first question.  The \nsecond question is: How can the enemies, like mãn, kãm, krodh, lobh, \nmad, matsar, and irshyã, be destroyed?” \n \n78.19 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “A person who is absolutely loyal to \nsatsang cannot at all tolerate someone speaking unkindly of satsang.  \nFor example, even though a person may have had a disagreement \nwith a member of his family, he would be unable to tolerate anyone \nspeaking unkindly of them.  Therefore, just as a person is loyal to his \nrelatives, if a person is similarly loyal to satsang, then his foundation \nin satsang is stable. \nGADHADÃ I \n- 210 - \n78.20 “The answer to the second question is as follows:  If a person has \nsuch loyalty for satsang, how can he possibly hold mãn or irshyã \ntowards sant or satsangis?  Therefore, all the inner enemies, like mãn, \nmad, matsar, and irshyã, of a person who is loyal to satsang are \ndestroyed.  However, if a person does not have this loyalty for \nsatsangis, and regards satsangis and kusangis as equal, then however \nhighly he may be regarded in satsang, he is sure to become a vimukh.” \n \n78.21 Then, Nãnã Ãtmãnand Swãmi asked, “Bhagvãn and His sant may \nboldly tell someone whatever needs to be said, with the belief, \n‘Whether he is praised or lectured, he will not fall from satsang in any \nway’.  How can a person earn this trust of Bhagvãn and His sant?  \nThat is one question.  The second question is:  How can a person win \nthe love of all the sãdhus, just as he has won the love of the sãdhu he \nis presently staying with?” \n \n78.22 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “As in the answer to Shivãnand Swãmi’s \nquestion, if a person is extremely loyal to satsang, Bhagvãn and His \nsant do not hesitate in lecturing him.  They never lack faith in him, \nand they never feel, ‘If he is lectured, he will leave satsang’.  Instead, \nthey have firm faith and believe, ‘His satsang is firm, and so there is no \ndanger in lecturing him’. \n \n78.23 “The answer to the second question is:  He may leave the person he \nwas previously staying with because he was unable to get along with \nhim, and subsequently go and stay with another person.  Despite this, \nhe is unable to tolerate others speaking unkindly of the person he \noriginally stayed with.  Therefore, all the sãdhus feel, ‘This person is \nnot ungrateful.  He is a very good sãdhu because he has not forgotten \nthat he is thankful to the person from whom he has learnt even a little’.  \nRealising this, all the sãdhus like him.  On the other hand, if he speaks \nunkindly of the person he originally stayed with, all the sãdhus feel, \n‘This person is ungrateful.  In the future, if he does not get along with \nany of us, he will surely speak unkindly of us too’.  As a result, no one \nlikes him.” \nGADHADÃ I \n- 211 - \n78.24 Then, Daharãnand Swãmi asked, “Bhagvãn is greater than Akshar, \nmind and speech, and He is invisible to all.  Then, why can everyone \nsee Him as pratyaksha?” \n \n78.25 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Bhagvãn – who is beyond Akshar, mind and \nspeech, and who is invisible – Himself, out of compassion, decides, \n‘May all the enlightened and unenlightened people in Mrutyu-Lok see \nme’.  Having decided this, Bhagvãn, who will always prevail, becomes \nvisible to all people in Mrutyu-Lok out of compassion.” \n \n78.26 Tyãgãnand Swãmi then asked, “How is Bhagvãn pleased?” \n \n78.27 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “A person who wants to please Bhagvãn \nshould not wish for bodily comforts.  He should not even crave for \nthe darshan of Bhagvãn.  To do exactly as Bhagvãn commands, is the \nonly way to please Bhagvãn.” \n \n78.28 Then, Lakshmanãnand Swãmi asked, “With what understanding is a \nperson able to feel the wonder of having attained the profound \nassociation of Bhagvãn and His sãdhus?  Also, how can he feel joyful \nall day and night?” \n \n78.29 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A bhakta realises, ‘This Bhagvãn and these \nsãdhus all reside in Vaikunth, Golok, and Brahmpur.  In fact, all of those \ndhãms are present wherever Bhagvãn and these sãdhus reside.  \nTherefore, I am extremely fortunate in that I am able to stay in the \npresence of these sãdhus’.  If he understands this, then he will \nexperience happiness all day and night, and will sway in an ocean of \nbliss throughout the day.” \n \n78.30 Paramãtmãnand Swãmi then asked, “How can a person acquire the \nthirty characteristics of a sãdhu described in the eleventh skandh of \nthe Shreemad Bhãgvat?” \n \n78.31 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person who regards a sant, who possesses \nthe thirty characteristics, as a guru and as a dev, and associates with \nGADHADÃ I \n- 212 - \nhim by thought, word, and deed, acquires those thirty characteristics.  \nIn fact, all the shãstras state, ‘When a person serves a sant, he becomes \nlike the sant’.” \n \n78.32 Then, Shãntãnand Swãmi asked, “There is one bhakta who constantly \nmaintains his vrutti on the svarup of Bhagvãn.  There is another \nbhakta who engages in bhajan and smaran, and also listens to and \nengages in kathã and kirtans of Bhagvãn.  Which bhakta of Bhagvãn is \nthe better of the two?” \n \n78.33 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “A person who experiences nirvikalp \nsamãdhi and is not conscious of his body, is the better of the two, \neven if he does not engage in kathã and kirtans of Bhagvãn.  Also, \nthere may be someone who is conscious of his body and gets up from \nworship of his own accord to eat, drink, and perform all bodily \nactivities, and still does not listen to or engage in the kathã and \nkirtans of Bhagvãn.  In comparison to him, a person who does listen \nto kathãs and kirtans is better.” \n \n78.34 Ãdhãrãnand Swãmi then asked, “How should we behave so that \nBhagvãn and His sant become pleased?” \n \n78.35 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If we strictly follow the panch-vartmãn, and \ndo not allow any sort of failure in following them, Bhagvãn and His \nsant will be pleased.  There is not even the slightest doubt about this.” \n \n78.36 Then, Vedãntãnand Swãmi asked, “If a person has previously \nbehaved improperly, what can a person do to please Bhagvãn and His \nsant?” \n \n78.37 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “Bhagvãn and His sant become displeased \nupon seeing impure svabhãvs within a person.  When we develop a \nhate towards those svabhãvs, a sant also realises this.  This is because \nwhenever a person has hatred towards someone, the whole world \nGADHADÃ I \n- 213 - \nknows.  As a result of this, a sant, who himself is also an enemy of \nthose svabhãvs, sides with us and imparts compassion upon us, \nshowing us the way to conquer those svabhãvs by whichever means \npossible.   \n \n78.38 “Therefore, after developing a bitter hatred towards root svabhãvs \nthat has led to a person’s disgrace, he should adopt a method that \nwould totally remove it.  When we behave in this way, Bhagvãn and \nHis sant shower total compassion upon us.  Whenever Bhagvãn and \nHis sant shower their compassion, a person continues to experience \nextreme bliss within his heart.  Also, a person’s ability to walk on the \npath of kalyãn increases, and the strength of his enemies, such as \nkãm, krodh and lobh, decreases.  Therefore, Bhagvãn does help a \nperson who keeps intense hatred towards that bitter enemy which \ncauses distress within his heart, which is why it is necessary to have \nhatred for the enemies, like kãm and krodh.  It is therefore very \nbeneficial to develop hatred towards his enemies.” \n \n78.39 Then, Bhagvadãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, just as a person fears \nBhagvãn when he is near Him, what understanding should a person \nhave so that he fears Bhagvãn just as much when he is far from Him?” \n \n78.40 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “Just as a person maintains the respect of \nBhagvãn when He is near, the same respect remains when He is far if \nhe thoroughly understands the greatness of Bhagvãn.  The greatness \nshould be understood as follows:  ‘Purushottam Bhagvãn – who is \ngreater than Akshar; by whose wish, countless millions of brahmãnds \nare created, and then supported by His powers;  who is vyatirek, yet is \npresent within everything as anvay, and while being anvay, is also \nvyatirek from everything; who dwells within each and every atom in \nHis antaryãmi svarup just as He is in His pratyaksha svarup; without \nwhose wish, not even a blade of grass is able to move; who is \nresponsible for creating, sustaining, and destroying countless millions \nof brahmãnds; who administers pain and pleasure to the beings \nGADHADÃ I \n- 214 - \nresiding in these brahmãnds; who is the sole doer of all that happens – \nincarnates on this earth for the kalyãn of the jeevs.   \n \n78.41 “‘However, when that very Bhagvãn mounts a horse, it appears that the \nhorse is carrying Him.  But in reality, it is Bhagvãn who is the upholder \nof the horse.  Furthermore, when Bhagvãn sits on the earth, it seems \nthat the earth is supporting Bhagvãn, but in reality, it is Bhagvãn who \nsupports the entire earth along with its sthãvar and jangam forms of \nlife. \n \n78.42 “‘At night, the light of the moon, an oil lamp, or a torch allows a person \nto have the darshan of Bhagvãn.  During the day, the light of the sun \nallows a person to have the darshan of Bhagvãn.  In reality, however, it \nis that Bhagvãn who provides light to the sun, the moon, and the flames \nof fire.  These are the magnificent powers of Bhagvãn.  Despite this, \nBhagvãn has become like a human for the sake of the kalyãn of the \njeevs, and He is giving darshan to me’.  If a person understands the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn in this way, then he can keep the same respect \nfor Bhagvãn when he is far from Him as when he is near Him.” \n \n78.43 Bhagvadãnand Swãmi then asked another question: “Nothing \nhappens without Bhagvãn’s will.  Everything that happens is all the \nwork of Bhagvãn alone.  So, when Bhagvãn or His bhaktas encounter \ndifficulties, why does He not ease their distress?  Why does He wish \nto increase their distress?” \n \n78.44 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “When Bhagvãn assumes a human svarup, \nit is normal for Him to behave in absolutely the same way as humans \ndo, and not reveal His alokik powers.  This is how all the charitras of \nBhagvãn are described in the shãstras.  Therefore, a person may only \nhave doubts when Bhagvãn exhibits new charitras.  But, as long as \nthe charitras of Bhagvãn are like those performed by the previous \navatãrs, there should be no doubts in a person’s mind.” \n \nGADHADÃ I \n- 215 - \n78.45 Then, Nirmalãnand Swãmi asked, “What understanding is required to \nthoroughly realise the greatness of a sant of Bhagvãn?” \n \n78.46 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “When a person thinks about the greatness \nof Matsya, Kurma, Varãh, Vãman, Parshurãm, Rãm, Krishna, and the \ncountless avatãrs of Bhagvãn, and thinks, ‘Bhagvãn has freed \ncountless jeevs through Rãm, Krishna, and other avatars, and I am \nextremely fortunate that I have attained the profound association of a \nsant of that very Bhagvãn’, he begins to thoroughly realise the \ngreatness of the sant day by day.” \n78.47 Then, Nãrãyanãnand Swãmi asked, “How is the jeev anvay with the \nthree bodies of sthul, sukshma, and kãran, and how is it vyatirek from \nthem?” \n \n78.48 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “When the body encounters pleasures and \npain, and the jeev takes on that pleasure and pain upon itself, the jeev \nis anvay with the three bodies.  When it believes itself to be distinct \nfrom the pleasures and pain of the three bodies, then the jeev is \nvyatirek from them.” \n \n78.49 Shunyãtitãnand Swãmi then asked, “When a person initially practices \nsatsang, he has deep love for sant and satsangis.  But, why does this \nlove later decline?” \n \n78.50 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “Initially, he holds very high respect for a \nsant.  Later, when he perceives a minor avgun in the sant, he regards \nit as a minor avgun because of his own malicious mind.  As a result, \nhis vicious nature flourishes, and his respect for the sant declines.  \nThen, if he thoughtfully eradicates this vicious nature, he becomes as \npure as he was before.  However, if he does not do so, he will \nultimately become a vimukh.” \n \n78.51 Prasãdãnand Swãmi then asked, “What is the cause of the jeev’s \nmoksh?” \nGADHADÃ I \n- 216 - \n78.52 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “To do exactly as a sant says without \nhaving any doubts, is the only cause of the jeev’s moksh.” \n \n78.53 Then, Trigunãtitãnand Swãmi asked, “What methods should a person \nadopt when faced with unpleasant desh, kãl, kriyã, and sang?” \n \n78.54 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The only way to overcome unpleasant \ndesh, kãl, kriyã, and sang, is to escape from them by any means \npossible.” \n78.55 Nãnã Nirvikãrãnand Swãmi then asked, “Despite having nishchay in \nBhagvãn, why is a person’s vãsnã not eradicated?” \n \n78.56 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person’s vãsnã is not eradicated because \nhe has not fully realised the greatness of Bhagvãn.” \n \n78.57 Then, Motã Yogãnand Swãmi asked, “Despite having perfect nishchay \nin Bhagvãn, why does a person still not develop love for Bhagvãn and \nthe kathãs of Bhagvãn?” \n \n78.58 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “It is because he has not yet realised the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn as it is.  If a person thoroughly realises the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn, then he does not develop love for anything else \nbesides Bhagvãn, even if he tries.  In addition, he develops constant \nlove only for Bhagvãn, His sant, and the kathãs and kirtans of \nBhagvãn.” \n \n78.59 Then, Pratoshãnand Swãmi asked, “How can a person’s bhakti \ntowards Bhagvãn remain constant?” \n \n78.60 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a person thoroughly understands the \ngreatness of pratyaksha Shree Krishna Purushottam – who is the \ncause of the four avatãrs of Aniruddha, Pradyumna, Sankarshan, and \nVãsudev, and who is the cause of the twenty-four avatãrs – then he \nGADHADÃ I \n- 217 - \nremains steady in the nine types of bhakti towards Bhagvãn, like \nsmaran and kirtan.” \n \n78.61 After answering the questions of all the munis in this way, Shreeji \nMahãrãj asked them all, “Kãm, krodh, and lobh are the three gateways \nto Narak.  All of you please reveal if you have thoroughly conquered \nany of these.” \n \n78.62 The munis then spoke about the ones they had conquered.  Hearing \nthis from the munis, Shreeji Mahãrãj became extremely pleased.  \nAfter happily imprinting His holy feet on the chests of Ãtmãnand \nSwãmi, Yogãnand Swãmi, Bhagvadãnand Swãmi, and Shivãnand \nSwãmi, He added, “Just as Mahãnubhavãnand Swãmi and the others, \nare senior munis, these four munis should also be considered senior \nalong with them.  Therefore, do not allow anyone to insult them.” \n \n78.63 Having advised Muktãnand Swãmi and the other senior sãdhus in this \nway, Shreeji Mahãrãj bid “Jay Sachidãnand” to everyone and returned \nto His residence for His meal.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 78 || 78 || \n \n \n|| End of Shree Gadhadã Pratham Prakaran || \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 218 - \n|| SHREE SWÃMINÃRAYAN VIJAYTETRÃM || \n \n \nVACHANÃMRUT \nShree Sãrangpur Prakaran \n \nSãrangpur – 1 \nConquering The Mind \n \n1.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Shrãvan vad 5 [28th August, 1820], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda \noutside the north-facing rooms of Jeevã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nSãrangpur.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of \nmunis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n1.2 \nThen, Muktãnand Swãmi asked a question: “The shlok ‘jitam jagat ken \nmano hee yen’ explains that a person who has conquered the mind \nhas conquered the whole world.  But, how can a person know \nwhether the mind has been conquered?” \n \n1.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “When the indriyas withdraw from the \npanch-vishays (shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh) and no desire to \nindulge in those vishays remains, then all the indriyas are said to be \nconquered.  Also, when the indriyas do not come into contact with the \nvishays, the mind also does not come into contact with the indriyas, \nand its vrutti remains within the heart.  In this way, a person who has \nrejected the panch-vishays with absolute determination should be \nknown as having conquered his mind.  But, if a person does have \nsome love for the vishays, then even if he has conquered his mind, it \nshould not be known as having been conquered.” \n \n1.4 \nAgain, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Can the vishays be defeated by \nvairãgya, or are they defeated by love for Bhagvãn?” \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 219 - \n1.5 \nShreeji Mahãrãj explained, “One way to defeat the vishays is ãtmã-\nnishthã, and the other is the realisation of Bhagvãn coupled with the \nknowledge of His greatness.  Specifically, ãtmã-nishthã should be of \nthe following type:  ‘I am chaitanya, while the body is jad; I am pure, \nwhereas the body is impure; I am imperishable, while the body is \nperishable; I am the embodiment of bliss, whereas the body is the \nembodiment of misery’.  In this way, when a person realises the ãtmã \nto be totally distinct from the body in every way, he will never \nconsider himself to be the body nor will he have love for the vishays.  \nThat is how the vishays are restrained through knowledge of the \nãtmã. \n \n1.6 \n“Also, a person should think of the greatness of Bhagvãn in the \nfollowing way:  ‘I am the ãtmã, while pratyaksha Bhagvãn, whom I \nhave attained, is Paramãtmã.  I have attained Shree Purushottam \nBhagvãn in person, the very Purushottam Bhagvãn who is the lord of \nGolok, Vaikunth, Shvet-Dvip, and Brahmpur, as well as the master of \nBrahmã and the other devs, who themselves are the lords of countless \nmillions of brahmãnds.  That Paramãtmã forever resides in my ãtmã.  I \nwould discard all of my pleasures for the vishays of countless millions of \nbrahmãnds, just for one second of darshan of that Bhagvãn.  Moreover, \nif a person were to gather together all the pleasures of the vishays of \ncountless millions of brahmãnds, even then it would not equal even one \nmillionth of a fraction of the bliss which is present in just one pore of \nBhagvãn.  In fact, in the Moksh-Dharma, it is said that the loks of the \nother devs are like Narak, compared to the Akshardhãm of Bhagvãn.  It \nis that very Bhagvãn whom I have attained in His pratyaksha svarup.  \nSo how can I possibly discard Him and wish for the pleasures of the \nvishays, which are like the pits of Narak?  The pleasures of the vishays \nare nothing but the embodiment of misery’.  So, the vishays can be \nrestrained by realising Bhagvãn’s greatness in this way. \n \n1.7 \n“The vairãgya generated by knowledge of ãtmã and Paramãtmã is \nsuch that it eradicates desires of the pleasures of all vishays.  A \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 220 - \nperson who has rejected the pleasures of the vishays by developing \nan understanding in this way, never again develops love for the \nvishays.  Only such a person’s mind can be said to be conquered. \n \n1.8 \n“Without this understanding, it may appear that a person has love, \nbut when he encounters an appealing vishay, he abandons Bhagvãn \nand develops love for that object.  Or, if he develops love for his son \nor wife, or he suffers an illness, or the pleasures of the vishays \ndisappear, then his love for Bhagvãn decreases, and he becomes \nconfused.  Just as a dog’s puppy appears cute when it is young, the \nbhakti of such a person initially appears to be good, but ultimately it \ndoes not remain appealing.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 1 || 79 || \n \n \nSãrangpur – 2 \nDeveloping Love For Bhagvãn \n \n2.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Shrãvan vad 6 [29th August, 1820], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting facing north, on a decorated bedstead \nwhich had been placed on the veranda outside the north-facing \nrooms of Jeevã Khãchar’s darbãr in Sãrangpur.  He was wearing a \nwhite khes and had tied a white pãgh around His head.  He had also \ncovered Himself with a white pachhedi.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n2.2 \nThen, addressing the munis, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please begin a \nquestion-answer discussion amongst yourselves.” \n \n2.3 \nSvayamprakãshãnand Swãmi then asked, “How can a bhakta of \nBhagvãn develop intense love for the murti of Bhagvãn?” \n \n2.4 \nThe munis then attempted to answer the question amongst \nthemselves, but were unable to give a precise answer. \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 221 - \n2.5 \nSo, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Love can develop due to beauty, due to \nlust, due to greed, due to some selfish motives, or due to the other \nperson’s qualities.  Of these, love which stems from beauty lasts only \nuntil a person sees the disfigurement caused by leprosy in the other \nperson’s body, or until the person develops leukoderma.  After that, \nthe love which once existed would dissolve.  In the same way, love \nstemming from greed, lust, and selfishness also eventually dissolves.  \nHowever, love developed due to the other person’s qualities, \nultimately survives.” \n \n2.6 \nThen, Somlã Khãchar asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “Which qualities are \nthese?  Are they external ones, or internal ones?” \n \n2.7 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “How is it possible to develop love due to \nexternal qualities?  To be more precise, it is love stemming from the \nqualities of the person’s speech, thoughts, and deeds, which does not \ndissolve.  Now, are you asking only about a bhakta developing love \nfor Bhagvãn?  Or, are you also asking about Bhagvãn developing love \nfor the bhakta?” \n \n2.8 \nSvayamprakãshãnand Swãmi clarified, “We are asking about both.” \n \n2.9 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then began to explain by saying, “A person should \nnot hurt any living being with his speech.  Also, during a question-\nanswer discussion where principles are being debated with Bhagvãn \nand a senior sãdhu, those who are junior should give in to those who \nare senior.  Also, in a sabhã, he should not ask questions that may \nembarrass a sãdhu who is senior to himself.  Instead, he should \npurposely accept defeat before Bhagvãn and a senior sãdhu, \nregardless of whether it seems appropriate or inappropriate.  Of \nthese, he would not doubt an appropriate ãgnã.  But, even if it seems \ninappropriate and leads to doubts, he should not refuse to abide by it, \nat least at that time.  He should certainly agree and say, ‘Mahãrãj, I \nwill do just as you say’.  If that ãgnã is such that he cannot accept it, \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 222 - \nand if it is the wish of Bhagvãn and a senior sãdhu to hear his plea, \nthen he should fold his hands before them and say with bhakti, \n‘Mahãrãj,  the ãgnã which you gave me is fine, but I have certain doubts \nabout it’.  In this way, he should speak modestly.  However, if it is not \nreally the wish of Bhagvãn to hear his plea, then he should say to a \nsenior sãdhu or a bhakta who is close to Him, ‘Although Bhagvãn has \ngiven such an ãgnã, I simply cannot accept it’.  Then, the senior sãdhu \nwould find a compromise regarding that ãgnã.  However, regardless \nof whether the ãgnã seems appropriate or inappropriate, he should \nnot immediately refuse to abide by it.  He should use politeness to \ndelay the following of the ãgnã given by those who are senior, but \nwhen initially told, he should not immediately refuse.  This is how a \nperson should behave regarding the qualities of speech.  As a result, \nBhagvãn and the senior sãdhu develop love for that bhakta, and the \nbhakta also develops strong love towards Bhagvãn. \n \n2.10 “Next, how should a person behave physically?  Well, if his body \nseems to be hyperactive, he should weaken it by engaging in bhajan \nor by keeping the chãndrãyan vrat.  Then, on noticing this, it is well \nand good if Bhagvãn or a senior sãdhu takes care of his body.  \nHowever, he should knowingly take care of his own body.  Also, he \nshould physically serve Bhagvãn and His bhaktas.  When Bhagvãn or \na great sãdhu notices a person behaving in this way physically, they \ndevelop love for him, and that bhakta also develops love for Bhagvãn. \n \n2.11 “Now, I shall describe the way in which a person should behave \nregarding the qualities of the mind.  When a bhakta does darshan of \nBhagvãn, he should do so with a focused mind and concentrated \nvision.  Instead, when a person, or a dog, or some other animals, or a \nbird, disturbs him while he is performing darshan of Bhagvãn, then \nhis vrutti is broken from Bhagvãn’s darshan.  He begins to glance here \nand there, up and down, and also see them at the same time.  \nBhagvãn and the senior sãdhus are not at all pleased upon seeing a \nperson with such wandering vision. \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 223 - \n2.12 “When such a bhakta does perform darshan, how does he do it?  Well, \nhe does it just as any ordinary person does.  A person who has such \nan ordinary vision, should be known to be like a squirrel that squeaks \nand raises its tail at the same time.  He performs darshan of Bhagvãn \nand notices other objects at the same time.  When he begins to \nperform darshan in such an ordinary way, he does not remain as \ndevout as he previously was, and he declines day by day.  Therefore, \nwhile performing darshan of Bhagvãn a person should not look from \nside to side.  \n \n2.13 “The novelty and divinity experienced in a person’s heart at the time \nof the first darshan of Bhagvãn, should remain exactly the same.  \nMoreover, he should look at the murti with a fixed gaze, and then \nclosing his eyes, he should internalise that murti, exactly as it, is in his \nheart.  For example, in Dharmapur, Kushalkunvar-Bãi did my \ndarshan, and at the same time, closed her eyes and internalised the \nmurti in her heart.  Similarly, a person should perform darshan with \nan attentive mind and a fixed gaze, but he should not perform \ndarshan as other ordinary people do.  If, along with the darshan of \nBhagvãn, he also looks at the other people, or cats, or dogs, then \nwhen he has a dream, he sees not only Bhagvãn, but also those other \nobjects.  That is why a person should perform darshan of Bhagvãn \nwith a fixed gaze, and not with a wandering gaze. \n  \n2.14 “A person who performs darshan of Bhagvãn while keeping his sight \nunder control, will feel that darshan to be continually new.  In \naddition, he would also feel any ãgnã that Bhagvãn may have given, \nto be new.  On the other hand, a person who performs darshan \nsuperficially, with a ordinary vision, would feel Bhagvãn’s darshan \nand ãgnã to be ordinary.  Although he may perform darshan every \nday, for such a person it is as if he has not performed darshan at all.  \nWhen such a person engages in bhajan, his mind would not remain \nstable.  Specifically, when he attempts to concentrate on Bhagvãn \nwhile his thinking is dispersed, other objects he may have seen would \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 224 - \nspontaneously come into his mind, along with Bhagvãn.  Therefore, a \nperson should perform darshan only of Bhagvãn.  The mind of this \nperson remains only on Bhagvãn during bhajan and smaran.  His \nthinking does not become dispersed.  Instead, it becomes \nconcentrated. \n \n2.15 “Furthermore, I am able to determine when a person is performing \ndarshan with wandering eyes.  A great sãdhu whose own sight and \nmind are kept under control also realises, ‘This person is performing \ndarshan in a superficial way’.  A person who performs darshan in such \nan ordinary way, then begins to decline from satsang day by day. \n \n2.16 “For example, a man who is overcome by kãm fixes his gaze on a \nbeautiful woman with a focused mind.  At that time, if some animal or \nbird were to pass by or make a noise, he would not notice it.  In the \nsame way, a person should attach himself to Bhagvãn with a similarly \nfocused gaze, but he should not perform darshan in an ordinary way.” \n \n2.17 Then, Nirvikãrãnand Swãmi raised a doubt, “Mahãrãj, we have to \ntravel and speak to people all over the country.  As a result, our mind \ndoes not remain concentrated.” \n \n2.18 In reply, Shreeji Mahãrãj questioned, “I have given an ãgnã for you to \nspeak to people, but when have I ever given an ãgnã for you to ignore \nthe darshan of this murti and perform darshan of other things?” \n \n2.19 Having said this, Mahãrãj continued, “The same divinity that a person \nfeels when he has darshan of the murti of Bhagvãn for the first time, \ncan be retained if he keeps his mind and gaze fixed on Bhagvãn.  So, \nwhen he behaves in this way, in accordance with the qualities of the \nmind mentioned previously, then the love that Bhagvãn has for that \nbhakta remains renewed.  Moreover, the love which that bhakta has \ntowards Bhagvãn also constantly remains renewed. \n \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 225 - \n2.20 “Also, both the eyes and ears should especially be kept under control.  \nThis is because worldly talks are prevalent everywhere.  If a person is \nattracted towards them through the vrutti of the ears, and he listens \nto them, then all of those worldly words would be recalled when he \nattempts to engage himself in bhajan.  Furthermore, anything seen by \na person who has a wandering gaze, is also recalled during bhajan.  \nThat is why both of these indriyas should be kept strictly under \ncontrol.  However, while performing darshan of Bhagvãn’s murti, if \nthe vrutti of  person’s eyes and ears leaves the murti aside and is \nattracted towards other things, he should lecture them, by saying, ‘O \nfools!  What are you going to achieve by looking at svarups other than \nBhagvãn, and by listening to words other than the talks of Bhagvãn?  \nAs of yet, you have not attained siddh-dashã where you can instantly \nreceive whatever you wish.  This is because you are still in the process \nof attaining siddh-dashã.  As a result, you are not going to be able to \nobtain those vishays that you desire.  So, why are you pointlessly \ngrasping for them and leaving Bhagvãn aside?  Moreover, even if you \nwere to attain some insignificant vishay, then due to the sin incurred as \na result, there will be no end to the beatings you will receive in \nYampuri’.  In this way, a person should tell off his eyes and ears. \n \n2.21 “A person should also tell them, ‘When you become stabilised in the \nmurti of Bhagvãn, you will attain siddh-dashã in this very life.  As a \nresult, you will be able to naturally hear any talks occurring in any \nbrahmãnd.  If you desire to have a charming svarup like that of \nBrahmã, Vishnu, or Shiv, then you will be able to attain such a svarup.  \nOr, if you wish, you will become a bhakta like Lakshmi or Rãdhikã.  \nMoreover, while worshipping Bhagvãn, if you do not attain siddh-dashã \nin this very life, you will attain siddh-dashã after death when you \nbecome a mukta.  However, without attaining siddh-dashã, even if you \nconstantly look at some beautiful object until you die, you will still not \nbe able to attain that beauty; and even if you listen to worldly talks \nuntil you die, you will still not attain anything.  Instead, your mind will \nbecome extremely polluted by it’.  In this way, a person should advise \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 226 - \nhis eyes and ears, and keep them fixed only on the murti of Bhagvãn.  \nA person, who behaves in this way, increasingly develops love for the \nmurti of Bhagvãn day by day.  As a result, Bhagvãn’s love and the \ngreat sãdhu’s love for that bhakta, also increases day by day.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 2 || 80 || \n \n \nSãrangpur – 3 \n‘Shravan’, ‘Manan’, ‘Nididhyãs’, ‘Sãkshãtkãr’ \nMãnsi Pujã \n \n3.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on the evening of Shrãvan vad 7 [30th \nAugust, 1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead \non the veranda outside the rooms of Jeevã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nSãrangpur.  He was wearing a white khes and had tied a white pãgh \naround His head.  He had also covered Himself with a black-bordered \nkhes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n3.2 \nSvayamprakãshãnand Swãmi then asked Shreeji Mahãrãj a question: \n“Mahãrãj, suppose there is a bhakta who physically performs pujã of \npratyaksha Bhagvãn with various types pujã items.  Also, suppose \nthere is another bhakta who performs mãnsi pujã of Bhagvãn using \nvarious imaginary items.  Of the two, which bhakta is better?” \n \n3.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a person lovingly performs pujã of \nBhagvãn, with hair-raising sentiments and an emotion-filled voice, \nthen regardless of whether he performs physical pujã or mãnsi pujã, \nboth are superior.  On the other hand, if he performs pujã \nmechanically – without feeling love or excitement, and without \nshowing emotion in his voice – then regardless of whether he \nperforms physical pujã of Bhagvãn or mãnsi pujã of Bhagvãn, both \nare inferior.” \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 227 - \n3.4 \nThen, Somlã Khãchar asked, “By what characteristics can a person \nrecognise a bhakta who becomes overwhelmed with love while \nperforming physical pujã or mãnsi pujã of Bhagvãn?” \n \n3.5 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Such a person has intense shraddhã in \nperforming the pujã of Bhagvãn and serving Him, in listening to \nkathãs and talks related to Bhagvãn, and in singing kirtans.  He also \nunderstands the profound greatness of Bhagvãn.  With each passing \nday, both of these two aspects remain renewed, but never diminish.  \nFor example, Muktãnand Swãmi’s shraddhã and understanding of \nBhagvãn’s greatness are exactly the same today and just as new as \nthey were when I first saw him in Lojpur.  They have not diminished \nin any way whatsoever.  In the same way, such a bhakta should be \nrecognised by these two characteristics. \n \n3.6 \n“All the Yãdavs who stayed with Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, did not have \nsuch shraddhã or understanding of Bhagvãn’s greatness.  They served \nHim just like they would serve other kings.  Therefore, they did not \nachieve fame and are not even regarded as bhaktas.  On the other \nhand, Uddhavji served Shree Krishna Bhagvãn with shraddhã and an \nunderstanding of His greatness, and therefore he has been described \nas a great bhakta of Bhagvãn and has been extremely renowned in \nthe shãstras and in the world.” \n \n3.7 \nThen, Nirvikãrãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, what are shravan, \nmanan, nididhyãs, and sãkshãtkãr?” \n \n3.8 \nShreeji Mahãrãj explained, “To listen to a talk through the ears, is \nknown as shravan.  Then, after hearing the talk, to mentally think \nover the talk, and to discard parts of the talk which are not needed \nand to retain the parts of the talk which are useful, is known as \nmanan.  Then, after having mentally retained the talk with nishchay, \nthe practice of continuously recalling the talk day and night is known \nas nididhyãs.  Finally, when that talk is recalled exactly as it was, with \nabsolute clarity and sincerity, it is known as sãkshãtkãr. \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 228 - \n3.9 \n“If a person engages in shravan, manan, and nididhyãs about the \nsvarup of the ãtmã, then he will attain sãkshãtkãr of the ãtmã.  \nFurthermore, if a person engages in shravan, manan, and nididhyãs of \nBhagvãn, then he will attain sãkshãtkãr of Bhagvãn.  Sãkshãtkãr \ncannot be attained by doing shravan alone, without practicing both \nmanan and nididhyãs. \n \n3.10 “If a person does not practice manan and nididhyãs following the \ndarshan of Bhagvãn’s murti, then even if he performs darshan for \nthousands of years, he will not attain sãkshãtkãr of that murti.  This is \nbecause this kind of darshan is like having done only shravan.  On the \nother hand, if a person has had darshan of Bhagvãn’s entire body, and \nhas then done manan and nididhyãs of all the parts of His body, then \nhe will be able to easily recall those parts even today.  Conversely, a \nperson who has performed only darshan of Bhagvãn’s body would be \nunable to recall it, even if he attempted to recall it. \n \n3.11 “Also, there are some bhaktas who say, ‘We sit in meditation and try \nvery hard to recall Mahãrãj’s murti, yet we cannot visualise even a \nsingle part.  Then, how can we possibly envision the whole murti?’  The \nreason for this is the same as above – they merely perform darshan of \nthe murti, without doing manan and nididhyãs.  So, how can it be \nvisualised?  After all, if a person has merely seen even a worldly \nobject with his eyes, or merely listened to it with his ears, and it is \nnot later mentally recalled, it will be forgotten.  Then, how can he \nexpect to remember the murti of Bhagvãn, which is divya and not \nworldly, without doing manan and nididhyãs? \n \n3.12 “Therefore, if a person continuously engages in manan and nididhyãs \nafter performing darshan of Bhagvãn and listening to His talks, then \nhe will attain sãkshãtkãr of them.  Otherwise, even if he performs \ndarshan and shravan for the rest of his life, he will still not attain \nsãkshãtkãr.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 3 || 81 || \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 229 - \nSãrangpur – 4 \nÃtmã And Non-Ãtmã \n \n4.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Shrãvan vad 8 [31st August, 1820], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting facing north on a decorated bedstead on \nthe veranda outside the rooms of Jeevã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nSãrangpur.  He was wearing a white khes, and had tied a white pãgh \naround His head.  He had covered Himself with a white pachhedi.  A \nsabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \n4.2 \nSvayamprakãshãnand Swãmi then asked a question:  “Mahãrãj, how \nshould a person clearly understand the distinction between the ãtmã \nand non-ãtmã, which will never cause him to mistake ãtmã and non-\nãtmã to be one?” \n \n4.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “That which is understood clearly is \nbeneficial – whether it is understood by one verse, or by two verses, \nor by five verses, or by a hundred verses, or even by a thousand \nverses.  So, once a person has developed such a clear understanding, \nno misconception remains about the ãtmã and non-ãtmã being one.  \nFurthermore, only such clear understanding leads to happiness, \nwhereas a foolish understanding does not lead to happiness.  \nTherefore, a person should clearly understand, ‘I am the ãtmã, and \nnot a single one of my characteristics can be found in the body.  Also, \nnot one of the characteristics of the body – which is jad, full of misery, \nand perishable – can be found in me, since I am chaitanya’.  After \nmaking such a distinction and becoming totally free of worldly \ndesires, a person should believe himself to be chaitanya and then \nthink of Purushottam Bhagvãn.  Distinguishing between that which is \njad and that which is chaitanya in this way should be known as true \nwisdom. \n \n4.4 \n“However, a person who believes himself to be the ãtmã for a while, \nbut then believes himself to be the body for a while and fantasises \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 230 - \nabout women, should be known as a fool.  He will not experience \nhappiness in his heart.  For example, there may be some delicious \nfood which is comparable to amrut , but if just a small amount of \npoison were to be mixed with it, then that food would never give a \nperson pleasure, but would in fact lead to misery.  In the same way, a \nperson may think of that ãtmã all day, but if he believes himself to be \nthe body and fantasises about women, even for just a moment, then \nall of his thoughts are useless.  Therefore, a person should think only \nof the ãtmã, so he can become totally free of worldly desires. \n \n4.5 \n“Now, someone may doubt: ‘What will become of me if I do not \nbecome totally free of worldly desires and happen to die in that \nimperfect state?’  Well, a bhakta of Bhagvãn should never think like \nthat.  Instead, he should realise, ‘If anything dies, it is this body.  But as \nI am that ãtmã, which does not age and is immortal, I will never die’.  \nHaving developed such an understanding, he should maintain \ncourage, keep a firm mind, and discard all desires other than those of \nBhagvãn. \n \n4.6 \n“Then, in the process of eradicating worldly desires in this way, if a \nfew desires do remain, he will attain the Naraks described in the \nMoksh-Dharma.  Specifically, if a bhakta of Bhagvãn retains any \ndesires for the world, then he attains the loks of Indra and other devs.  \nAfter migrating to those loks, he experiences the pleasures of apsãrãs, \nheavenly vehicles, palaces decorated with jewels, and other luxuries \n– which are like Narak, in comparison to the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  \nHowever, a bhakta of Bhagvãn does not go to Yampuri, like a vimukh, \nnor does he re-enter the cycle of births and deaths. \n \n4.7 \n“Therefore, even if a bhakta of Bhagvãn has worldly desires, if \nnothing else, he will become a dev.  Then, having become a dev, he \nwill become a human again.  As a human, after offering bhakti to \nBhagvãn and becoming free of worldly desires, he will ultimately \nattain the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  But, he will not have to suffer from the \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 231 - \nmiseries of Narak or the cycle of births and deaths, like the vimukh.  \nBearing this in mind, a bhakta of Bhagvãn should not become \ndiscouraged on seeing the force of worldly desires.  Instead, he \nshould joyfully continue to worship Bhagvãn, continue in his \nattempts to eradicate his desires, and maintain absolute faith in the \nwords of Bhagvãn and His sant.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 4 || 82 || \n \n \nSãrangpur – 5 \nWorldly Desires Are Defeated By Bhakti \n \n5.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Shrãvan vad 9 [1st September, 1820], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeevã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Sãrangpur.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n5.2 \nThen, Muktãnand Swãmi asked a question: “Which method of \neradicating worldly desires is so powerful that it alone incorporates \nall other methods?” \n \n5.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The worldly desires of a person will be \neradicated, if he has the following four characteristics in his heart:  \nshraddhã, faith in the words of Bhagvãn and His bhaktas, love for \nBhagvãn, and the knowledge of the greatness of Bhagvãn’s svarup.  Of \nthese, if the knowledge of Bhagvãn’s greatness is extremely powerful \nand the other three – shraddhã, faith, and love – are weak, they will \nalso become extremely powerful.  On the other hand, although a \nperson may appear to have intense bhakti, if it is not coupled with the \nknowledge of Bhagvãn’s greatness, it will ultimately be destroyed.  \nFor example, a ten-year-old girl who has contracted tuberculosis will \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 232 - \ncertainly die before she matures into a young woman.  Similarly, a \nperson whose bhakti lacks the knowledge of Bhagvãn’s greatness will \nfind that his bhakti will be destroyed before it matures. \n \n5.4 \n“Furthermore, if a person has bhakti for Bhagvãn in his heart coupled \nwith the knowledge of Bhagvãn’s greatness, then even though he \ndoes not possess any other kalyãn-kãri qualities, they will still \ndevelop in his heart.  Conversely, if a person does not have bhakti in \nhis heart coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvãn’s greatness, then \neven though he possesses kalyãn-kãri qualities, such as tranquillity \nand self-restraint, they are as good as being absent because they will \nultimately be destroyed. \n \n5.5 \n“Therefore, even if a person has only bhakti coupled with the \nknowledge of Bhagvãn’s greatness, his worldly desires will still be \neradicated, and all the kalyãn-kãri qualities will develop and reside \nwithin his heart.  Bhakti of Bhagvãn coupled with the knowledge of \nHis greatness is the greatest and most reliable method to eradicate a \nperson’s worldly desires.” \n \n5.6 \nThen, Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi asked, “What is the anvay nature \nof the jeev, and what is its vyatirek nature?  What is the anvay nature \nof ishvar, and what is its vyatirek nature?  How should Purushottam \nBhagvãn be known in His anvay form, and how should He be known \nin His vyatirek form?” \n \n5.7 \nShreeji Mahãrãj explained, “When the jeev is said to experience births \nand deaths, that should be known as the jeev’s anvay form.  When the \njeev is said to be achhedhya, abhedhya, and avinãshi, that should be \nknown as the jeev’s vyatirek form. \n \n5.8 \n“When ishvar behaves as one with its three bodies of virãt, sutrãtmã, \nand avyãkrut, that should be known as the anvay form of ishvar.  \nWhen ishvar is described as sachidãnand, and as greater than its body \n(the brahmãnd), that should be known as the vyatirek form of ishvar. \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 233 - \n5.9 \n“The anvay form of Akshar is the inspirer of Prakruti-Purush and all \nthe devs, such as Surya, and Chandra.  The form in which there is not \neven a trace of the influence of Prakruti-Purush, and in which only \nPurushottam Bhagvãn resides, should be known as the vyatirek form \nof Akshar. \n \n5.10 “The anvay form of Purushottam is that which resides in the hearts of \nboth bound jeevs and released jeevs as their witness.  However, He \nremains untouched by such states of bondage and release.  In the \nsame way, He also resides in the hearts of ishvars and Akshar as their \nwitness, but He remains unaffected by their influence.  The form that \nis greater than jeev, ishvar, and Akshar should be known as the \nvyatirek form of Purushottam.  These are the anvay-vyatirek natures \nof the various entities.” \n \n5.11 Again, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Does the importance of Bhagvãn’s \ndarshan, the importance of chanting His holy name, and the \nimportance of the touch of Bhagvãn, apply only to the bhaktas of \nBhagvãn, or does it also apply to all beings?” \n \n5.12 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “The modes of darshan are certainly \ndifferent, so please listen as I explain them to you.  When a person \ndoes darshan of Bhagvãn with his eyes coupled with his mind, then \nthat darshan could not be forgotten, even if he tired to forget it.  In \nthe same way, if the skin is coupled with the mind when he touches \nBhagvãn, then that touch will also not be forgotten.  For example, the \nShreemad Bhãgvat narrates the words spoken by the gopis to \nBhagvãn:  ‘O Bhagvãn!  Since the day we touched your feet, all the \npleasures of the world, apart from you, have seemed like poison to us’.  \nSimilarly, when all the gnãn-indriyas are coupled with the mind and \nare then engaged in darshan, listening, and touching, the experiences \nare never forgotten. \n \n5.13 “To give another example, an ignorant person who indulges in the \nvishays when the five gnãn-indriyas are coupled with his mind, can \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 234 - \nnever forget them, even if he wants to forget them.  Similarly, only \nthat darshan of Bhagvãn, and listening to the talks of Bhagvãn, which \nhave been done with the mind engaged, should be known as darshan \nand listening. \n \n5.14 “On the other hand, a person may do darshan, but it is as good as not \nhaving done darshan at all.  This is because at the time he was doing \ndarshan, his mind was wandering elsewhere.  As a result, he will \ncertainly forget that darshan within a day, or maybe within five days, \nor maybe within fifty days, or maybe within six months, or maybe \nafter one year, or after five years; eventually, it will not remain. \n \n5.15 “Therefore, only a person who engages the five gnãn-indriyas (eyes, \nears, nose, tongue, skin) coupled with the mind, in the darshan and \ntouch of Bhagvãn with intense love and the understanding of His \ngreatness, attains the fruits of that darshan and touch.  Others, who \nhave the darshan and touch of Bhagvãn, attain only the seeds.  \nHowever, the real importance applies only to those who engage in \nthe darshan and touch, coupled with the mind.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 5 || 83 || \n \n \nSãrangpur – 6 \nTwo States Within Each Of The Three Mental States \nThe Four Types Of Speech \n \n6.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Shrãvan vad 10 [2nd September, 1820], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda \noutside the north-facing rooms of Jeevã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nSãrangpur.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of \nmunis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 235 - \n6.2 \nThen, Nityãnand Swãmi asked, “How do the mental states remain \nwithin each of the other mental states?” \n \n6.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The ‘state’ is where the jeevãtmã dwells, \nwhen it indulges in the vishays.  There are three types of mental \nstates:  jãgrat, svapna, and sushupti. \n \n6.4 \n“Of these, the jãgrat state is the result of the sustenance state of \nVirãt-Purush.  It is full of sattva-gun and is located in the region of the \neyes.  In that jãgrat state, the jeevãtmã is known as vishva.  Moreover, \nwith the consciousness of its sthul body, via the ten indriyas and the \nfour antah-karans, the jeevãtmã appropriately and carefully indulges \nin the pleasures of the external vishays according to its past karmas.  \nThis is known as the jãgrat state, in which sattva-gun is predominant. \n \n6.5 \n“Within the jãgrat state, if the jeevãtmã indulges in the pleasures of \nthe external vishays inappropriately due to some misconception, then \nthat is known as the svapna state within the jãgrat state.  In the \njãgrat state, if the jeevãtmã indulges in the pleasures of the external \nvishays irresponsibly, due to grief or fatigue, then that is known as \nsushupti within the jãgrat state. \n \n6.6 \n“The svapna state is the result of the creation state of Hiranyagarbh.  \nIt is full of rajo-gun and is located in the region of the throat.  In that \nsvapna state, the jeevãtmã is known as taijas.  With the consciousness \nof its sukshma body, via the indriyas and antah-karans, the jeevãtmã \nindulges in pleasurable and miserable vishays, which are temporary, \naccording to its past karmas.  This is known as the svapna state, in \nwhich rajo-gun in predominant. \n \n6.7 \n“Within the svapna state, if the jeevãtmã knowingly indulges in the \npleasures of the temporary vishays carefully and with awareness, \nexactly as it does during the jãgrat state, then that is known as the \njãgrat state within the svapna state.  However, if in that svapna state \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 236 - \nthe jeevãtmã, due to sluggishness, does not recognise those \ntemporary vishays which it experiences, then that is known as the \nsushupti state within the svapna state. \n \n6.8 \n“The sushupti state is the result of the destruction state of ishvar.  It is \nfull of tamo-gun and is located in the region of the heart.  When the \njeev is in that sushupti state, the vruttis of the indriyas and the antah-\nkaran, the desires for the pleasures of the vishays, and its sense of \nknower-ship and doer-ship, all become merged in the kãran body.  \nWhen the jeevãtmã, which has the consciousness of its kãran body, \nand is known as prãgna, remains fully absorbed in the bliss of sagun \nbrahm in the form of Pradhãn-Purush, it is known as the sushupti \nstate, in which tamo-gun is predominant. \n \n6.9 \n“Within the sushupti state, if a sense of doer-ship develops due to the \nimpressions of a person’s karmas, then that is known as the svapna \nstate within the sushupti state.  Then, opposing realisation of that \nsense of doer-ship – which disrupts the bliss of sushupti on account of \nthe agony of the pain experienced during jãgrat and svapna – is \nknown as the jãgrat state within the sushupti state. \n \n6.10 “In this way, the other two states reside within each individual state.  \nAlso, that which gives knowledge of these distinctions between the \nstates to the jeevãtmã, and who gives the jeev the rewards of its \nkarmas accordingly within those states, is known as turyapad, as the \nantaryãmi, as the drashtã, as Brahm, and also as Parbrahm.” \n \n6.11 Again, Nityãnand Swãmi asked, “How should a person understand \nthe four types of speech – ‘parã’, ‘pashyanti’, ‘madhyamã’, and \n‘vaikhari’?” \n \n6.12 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “That is a vast, as well as an extremely subtle \nsubject, but in the eleventh skandh of the Shreemad Bhãgvat, Shree \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 237 - \nKrishna Bhagvãn explains it to Uddhavji.  Please listen as I explain it \nin brief. \n \n6.13 “At the time of the first creation, after entering the thousand-petalled \nlotus which lies on the head of Virãt-Purush, Purushottam Bhagvãn \nproduced the ancient divine sound – like the sound of  Akshar-Brahm.  \nThen, via the sushumnã path, that divine sound pervaded the navel of \nVirãt-Purush.  Then, along with mahã-prãn, it rose upwards, and \ncaused Virãt-Purush’s lotus-navel – which was previously facing \ndownwards – to face upwards.  In this way, the divine sound \nproduced in the navel of Virãt-Purush is known as the ‘parã’ speech.  \nFor the purpose of creating the Veds, Bhagvãn Himself has inspired \nthat ‘parã’ speech.  Therefore, it is like a seed.  That ‘parã’ speech is \nlike a stream of light, and is the cause of the ‘ardhamãtrã’. \n \n6.14 “From there, the ‘parã’ speech reached the hruday-ãkãsh of Virãt-\nPurush, where it was known by the name of ‘pashyanti’.  From there it \nreached the region of the throat and became known by the name of \n‘madhyamã’.  From there, it reached the mouth of Virãt-Purush and \nreceived the name of ‘vaikhari’.  It then became the form of pranav by \nbecoming the three sounds of ‘A’, ‘U’, and ‘M’.  It then became the \nfifty-two syllables, and took the form the four Veds.  In this way, a \nperson should understand the four types of speech in Virãt-Purush – \n‘parã’, ‘pashyanti’, ‘madhyamã’, and ‘vaikhari’. \n \n6.15 “Now, I shall describe these four types of speech which also dwell \nwithin the body of the jeev, so please listen.  That same Purushottam \nBhagvãn resides in the jeev as antaryãmi.  He is independent, yet \ninterwoven with the three mental states of the jeev.  That same \nBhagvãn assumes an avatãr on this earth for the kalyãn of the jeevs.  \nAt that time, those jeevs describe the svarup of that Bhagvãn as well \nas His dhãms, qualities, and divine powers.  They describe His divya \ncharitras, make a distinction between ãtmã and non-ãtmã, and also \nindividually explain the differences between jeev, ishvar, mãyã, \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 238 - \nBrahm, and Parbrahm.  Such speech is known as ‘parã’.  Speech that \ngives a complete explanation of mãyik worldly entities and vishays is \nknown as ‘vaikhari’.  Speech that gives an incomplete explanation, \nand creates confusion of mãyik worldly entities and vishays, is known \nas ‘madhyamã’.  Finally, speech which blindly describes those mãyik \nworldly entities and vishays as being the same, and which cannot be \nunderstood, is known as ‘pashyãnti’. \n \n6.16 “In this way, the details of the four types of speech can be known in \nthe jãgrat state of the jeev.  The details of those four types of speech \nin the svapna and sushupti states can only be known by a person who \nhas mastered samãdhi – it cannot be known by others.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 6 || 84 || \n \n \nSãrangpur – 7 \nNaimishãranya Kshetra \n \n7.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Shrãvan vad 11 [3rd \nSeptember, 1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeevã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Sãrangpur.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n7.2 \nIn the sabhã, Shreeji Mahãrãj had requested the first skandh of the \nShreemad Bhãgvat Purãn to be read.  During the reading, the \nfollowing statement was encountered: ‘Wherever the jagged edges of \nthe manomay chakra are worn away, that place should be known as \nNaimishãranya Kshetra’.  Hearing this, Muktãnand Swãmi inquired, \n“Mahãrãj, what exactly is the manomay chakra, and what should a \nperson understand its jagged edges to be?” \n \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 239 - \n7.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj explained, “A person should understand the mind to \nbe the manomay chakra, and the ten indriyas to be its jagged edges.  \nWherever those jagged edges of the mind (the indriyas) wear away \nand become blunt, that place should be known as Naimishãranya \nKshetra.  Religious deeds (jap, tap, vrat, dhyãn, and pujã) commenced \nin that place flourish rapidly, day by day.  Furthermore, that \nNaimishãranya Kshetra should be known to be wherever Bhagvãn’s \nekãntik sant resides. \n \n7.4 \n“When the jagged edges of the manomay chakra are worn away, no \naffection remains towards any of the panch-vishays.  Then, even if a \nperson sees a beautiful woman, or extremely attractive clothes, or \njewellery, a strong hatred develops towards them deep within his \nmind.  However, the vruttis of indriyas would never cling to them. \n \n7.5 \n“For example, when an extremely sharp arrow pierces and lodges \ninto its target, it cannot be removed.  However, if that same arrow, \nwith its tip removed so that only its shaft remains, were to be shot at \na wall, it would rebound and fall to the ground.  It would not \npenetrate the wall like the sharp-tipped arrow.  Similarly, when the \njagged edges of the manomay chakra (the indriyas) are worn away, \nthen no matter how appealing the vishays may be, the vruttis of the \nindriyas would not be drawn towards them.  Instead, they would \nrebound like the blunt arrow-shaft.  When a person is able to behave \nin this way, the jagged edges of the manomay chakra can be said to \nhave been worn away. \n \n7.6 \n“So, a person should seek kalyãn wherever he sees such a \nNaimishãranya Kshetra in the form of the association of a sant, and he \nshould remain there with an absolutely firm mind.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 7 || 85 || \n \n \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 240 - \nSãrangpur – 8 \nThe Characteristics Of Irshyã \n \n8.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Shrãvan vad 12 [4th September, 1820], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeevã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Sãrangpur.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n8.2 \nChaitanyãnand Swãmi then asked, “Mahãrãj, what are the \ncharacteristics of irshyã?” \n \n8.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Irshyã develops from the mãn that a person \nholds within his heart.  In fact, krodh, matsar, and asuyã also arise out \nof mãn.  But the characteristic of irshyã is that a person cannot \ntolerate someone greater than himself being honoured.  A person \nwho has such a nature should be known to have irshyã with his heart.  \nMoreover, a person who has extreme irshyã cannot tolerate anyone’s \ngreatness.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 8 || 86 || \n \n \nSãrangpur – 9 \nThe Prevalence Of The Dharma Of The Yugs \n \n9.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Shrãvan vad 13 [5th September, 1820], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj walked from Sãrangpur and \narrived at Kundal to please His haribhaktas.  There, He was sitting \nfacing north on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the \nwest-facing rooms of Amrã Patgar’s home.  He had tied a white pãgh \naround His head.  He had covered Himself with a white pachhedi, and \nwas wearing a white survãl and white angarkhu.  A sabhã of munis, as \nwell as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 241 - \n9.2 \nMuktãnand Swãmi then asked, “Mahãrãj, why do the dharmas of the \nyugs prevail in a person’s heart?” \n  \n9.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The dharmas of the yugs prevail because of \nthe three gun.  When pure sattva-gun is prevalent, Satya-Yug prevails \nin the heart.  When rajo-gun is prevalent, Tretã-Yug prevails in the \nheart.  When rajo-gun and tamo-gun are prevalent together, Dvãpar-\nYug prevails in the heart.  Finally, when tamo-gun alone is prevalent, \nKali-Yug prevails in the heart.  In this way, the prevalence of the yugs \nis due to the gun.” \n \n9.4 \nMuktãnand Swãmi asked further, “What causes the activities of the \ngun?” \n \n9.5 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The cause of the activities of the gun are \nkarmas.  Specifically, the type of karmas a person has performed \npreviously, determines the gun that will prevail.  Therefore, if a \nperson, in whom rajo-gun and tamo-gun are prevalent, attempts to \nperform dhyãn on Bhagvãn, he will not be able to do so.  In such \nsituations, he should make use of the strength of ãtmã-nishthã and \nBhagvãn’s greatness.  He should realise, ‘I am the ãtmã.  Since I am \ngunãtit, there can be no mãyik influence within me’.  Furthermore, he \nshould realise Bhagvãn’s greatness in the following way:  ‘Ajãmel was \na terrible sinner and yet, because of his son, he uttered the name of \n“Nãrãyan”.  As a result, he was freed from all his sins and attained \nAkshardhãm.  I have attained that Bhagvãn in His pratyaksha svarup, \nand I chant His holy name day and night.  Therefore, I am fulfilled’.  \nThinking in such a way, he should always remain joyful. \n \n9.6 \n“However, a person in whom rajo-gun and tamo-gun are prevalent \nshould not insist on performing dhyãn.  Instead, he should engage in \nbhajan and smaran as much as possible.  Moreover, he should \nphysically serve Bhagvãn and His sant with shraddhã.  At the same \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 242 - \ntime, he should abide by his dharma and believe himself to be \nfulfilled.” \n9.7 \n Again, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Kali-Yug prevails in the heart of a \nperson who has accumulated many tãmasi karmas.  Is there any \nmethod to eradicate those karmas, or not?” \n \n9.8 \nShreeji Mahãrãj answered, “If he has intense shraddhã and extremely \nfirm faith in the words of Bhagvãn and His sant, then whatever type \nof tãmasi karmas he may have performed, they will be destroyed.  \nThe dharma of Kali-Yug will also vanish, and the dharma of Satya-Yug \nwill prevail.  Therefore, if a person practices satsang with absolute \nhonesty, then no fault will remain in his heart, and he will become \nbrahm-rup in this very lifetime.” \n \n9.9 \nThen, Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi asked, “What can be called \nsthãn?” \n \n9.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “An individual’s dharma according to the \nfour varnas and the four ãshrams should be known as sthãn.  You are \nall tyãgis, but if you were to leave this ãshram and tread the path of \ngrahasthas, then you would be known to have diverted from your \nsthãn.  So, even in the most difficult circumstances, or even if I were \nto issue an ãgnã, you should not deviate from your dharma.  \nMoreover, while grahasthas wish to perform my pujã by offering \nclothes and jewellery, you should not wish to do so.  Instead, you \nshould offer pujã by using leaves, flowers, fruits, and water, and you \nshould experience joy by performing this pujã.  It would not be \nappropriate for you to deviate from your dharma to perform pujã of \nBhagvãn.  Therefore, all of you should remain within your own \ndharma, and offer pujã within your capacity.  This is my ãgnã, so \nabide by it firmly.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 9 || 87 || \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 243 - \nSãrangpur – 10 \nDharma And Adharma \n \n10.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Shrãvan vad 14 [6th September, 1820], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was walking with all the sãdhus from Kundal and, \nalong the way, they arrived at Khãmbhdã.  They settled themselves \nunder a pipal tree.  The people of the village then brought a \ndecorated bedstead for Shreeji Mahãrãj to sit upon.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him.  Some of the sãdhus \nwere singing kirtans. \n \n10.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then asked the sãdhus to stop singing, and addressed \nthe village people, “In this world there are two types of people:  \nThose who follow the path of honesty (dharma) and those who \nfollow the path of sin (adharma).  Of these, the person who follows \nthe path of honesty, abandons stealing, adultery, slander and all other \nforms of sin.  Fearing Bhagvãn, such a person remains within the \ndisciplines of dharma.  As a result, everyone in the world trusts him, \nbe it a member of his family or anyone else; and whatever he says is \naccepted by all as the truth.  A person who follows dharma, likes the \ncompany of a true sant. \n \n10.3 “On the other hand, a person who follows the path of sin(adharma), \nis engrossed in evil deeds such as stealing, adultery, eating meat, \ndrinking alcohol, changing someone’s varna and ãshram by force, and \nhaving his own varna and ãshram changed by force.  As a result, no \none in the world ever trusts him.  In fact, even his own relatives do \nnot trust him.  Such a sinful person never likes the company of a true \nsant; and if someone else were to keep the company of a sant, the \nsinful person would spite him too. \n \n10.4 “Therefore, a person who aims to attain kalyãn, should not follow the \npath of sin (adharma).  Instead, he should follow the path of honesty \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 244 - \n(dharma), and keep the company of a true sãdhu.  As a result, he \nwould certainly, without a doubt, attain kalyãn.” \n \n10.5 Hearing this talk, many people of the village accepted the refuge of \nShreeji Mahãrãj.   \n \n10.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj then returned to Sãrangpur, and sat on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeevã \nKhãchar’s darbãr.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã \nof munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n10.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “If a person looks at the dhãms of Bhagvãn \n– Golok, Vaikunth, Shvet-Dvip, Brahmpur – from a physical \nperspective, they appear to be very far away.  However, if a person \nlooks at them from the ãtmã’s perspective, they are not even an \natom’s distance away.  Therefore, the understanding of a person who \nviews from a physical perspective is false, and the understanding of a \nperson who views from the perspective of the ãtmã is true.  In reality, \nBhagvãn and the dhãm of Bhagvãn are not even an atom’s distance \naway from a sãdhu who believes, ‘Bhagvãn is forever present in my \nchaitanya.  Just like the jeev resides in the body, Bhagvãn resides within \nmy jeev.  My jeev is the sharir, and Bhagvãn is the shariri of my jeev’.  \nSuch a sãdhu also believes that his jeevãtmã is distinct from the three \nbodies – sthul, sukshma, and kãran – and that Bhagvãn forever \nresides within his ãtmã.  Such a sant is like a mukta of Shvet-Dvip.  \nWhen a person has the darshan of such a sant, he should realise, ‘I \nhave had the darshan of Bhagvãn Himself’.  A person who has such an \nunderstanding has nothing more to attain. \n \n10.8 “If a person is unable to attain such an understanding, then he should \nmaintain profound associations with a sant.  If that sant were to daily \nbeat him five times with a pair of shoes, he should still tolerate such \ninsults.  In no way should he abandon his association with a sant, just \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 245 - \nas an opium addict cannot abandon his addiction.  Such a person \nshould be known to be equal to the sant mentioned earlier.  Also, \nwhatever that sant attains, a person who continues to profoundly \nassociate with such a sant, also attains.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 10 || 88 || \n \n \nSãrangpur – 11 \nPersonal Effort \n \n11.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Shrãvan vad Amãs [7th September, 1820], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeevã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Sãrangpur.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n11.2 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked a question: “Personal effort is \nmentioned in the shãstras, but how much is actually achieved by \npersonal effort, and how much is achieved by Bhagvãn’s grace?” \n \n11.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “A person who, by the words of a sadguru \nand the shãstras, has attained firm vairãgya, has firm shraddhã, \nstrictly follows the eight types of brahm-chãrya, has affection \ntowards ahinsã, and absolutely firmly realises himself to be the ãtmã, \nis relieved of the burden of births and deaths which hangs over his \nhead.  Then, just like a grain of rice that has had its outer chaff \nremoved does not grow, a mukta who has the gun just mentioned, is \nfreed from eternal ignorance in the form of mãyã.  He is therefore \nfreed from the cycle of births and deaths, and attains the state of \nãtmã-nishthã.  This much can be achieved by personal effort. \n \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 246 - \n11.4 “Bhagvãn’s grace is only bestowed upon a person who has these \ncharacteristics.  When he attains the grace of Bhagvãn, he becomes \nan ekãntik bhakta.  Even the Shrutis state: \n \nniranjanaha paramam sãmyam-upaiti \n \n“The meaning of this Vedic shlok is that a person who is free from the \nblemishes of mãyã, attains qualities similar to those of Bhagvãn.  Just \nas Bhagvãn is never bound by any pure or impure karmas that He \nmay perform, the mukta is also never bound by pure or impure \nkarmas. \n \n11.5 “Due to her love, Lakshmiji sometimes becomes absorbed in \nBhagvãn’s murti, whereas on other occasions, while remaining \nseparate from Bhagvãn, she remains in Bhagvãn’s sevã.  In the same \nway, out of intense love, the bhakta also sometimes becomes \nabsorbed in Bhagvãn, and at other times he is separate and remains \nin Bhagvãn’s sevã.  Moreover, just as Bhagvãn is independent, that \nbhakta also becomes independent.  These powers can only be \nattained by the grace of Bhagvãn.” \n \n11.6 Then, Nityãnand Swãmi asked, “Bhagvãn’s grace is bestowed upon a \nperson who has absorbed all these characteristics perfectly.  But, \nwhat becomes of a person who has some deficiency in developing \nthese characteristics?” \n \n11.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a person has a deficiency in any of the \nqualities of vairãgya, brahm-chãrya, shraddhã, ahinsã, and ãtmã-\nnishthã, then he does not attain ãtyantik moksh, and Bhagvãn’s \nAkshardhãm.  Instead, he attains some other dhãm of Bhagvãn.  If he \nhas even more worldly desires remaining, he attains the loks of the \ndevs.  In the Moksh-Dharma, these loks are described as being like \nNarak compared to the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  Then, after being a dev, he \nreturns to being a human, and from being a human he again becomes \na dev. \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 247 - \nanek-janma-sansiddh-stato yãti parãm gatim \nA yogi who has become siddh after many lives, attains Akshardhãm. \n \n“This shlok explains that a bhakta of Bhagvãn who has worldly \ndesires does not go to Narak, nor does he have to undergo births and \ndeaths in the cycle of 8.4 million life-forms.  Instead, he takes \ninnumerable births as a dev and a human being.  Then, only when he \ndevelops the previously described qualities of vairãgya, brahm-\nchãrya, shraddhã, ahinsã, and ãtmã-nishthã, does he become worthy \nof attaining the grace of Bhagvãn.  He then becomes an ekãntik \nbhakta of Bhagvãn, and attains His gunãtit dhãm, Akshardhãm. \n \n11.8 “So, whether it takes one life or innumerable lives, only when a \nperson develops the previously described characteristics and \nbecomes extremely free of worldly desires, does he become worthy \nof attaining the grace of Bhagvãn, and only then will he attain \nãtyantik moksh.  Without it, he will definitely not attain it.” \n \n11.9 Then, Nrusinhãnand Swãmi asked, “Is there a method by which a \nperson can eradicate all of his deficiencies within this very lifetime?” \n \n11.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a person becomes extremely vigilant and \ndetermined, then all of his deficiencies can be eradicated within this \nvery lifetime.  If his deficiencies have not been eradicated while he is \nalive, and if he were to become free of worldly desires and develop \nintense love for Bhagvãn during his last moments, then even in those \nlast moments Bhagvãn would shower His grace upon him, and he \nwould attain the dhãm of Bhagvãn. \n \n11.11 “Therefore, whether after one life, or after countless lives, or even in \nthe last moments before a person dies, should a bhakta’s vruttis \nbecome intensely focused on Bhagvãn, no deficiency would remain in \nthat bhakta.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 11 || 89 || \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 248 - \nSãrangpur – 12 \nThinking About The Ãtmã \n \n12.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Bhãdarvã sud 1 [8th September, 1820], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeevã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Sãrangpur.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n12.2 Then, Nirvikãrãnand Swãmi asked a question: “Which qualities \nconstantly remain in a sãdhu, and which qualities come and go?” \n \n12.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “First, there is ãtmã-nishthã; second, there is \nsvadharma; and third, there is nishchay in the svarup of Bhagvãn.  \nThese three qualities constantly remain in a sãdhu, whereas others \nmay come and may go.  Therefore, while other qualities come and go, \nthese three qualities will always remain.” \n \n12.4 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Why is it that even after \nunderstanding the distinction between the body and the ãtmã, a \nperson forgets that distinction, and continues to identify himself with \nthe body?” \n \n12.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “Once a person has clearly understood the \ndistinction between the body and the ãtmã, it cannot be forgotten.  \nEven if he believes, ‘I am the body’, he can no longer accept himself as \nthe body.  Also, once he has firmly established the belief of Bhagvãn, \neven if he tries to reject it, it cannot be rejected.  Furthermore, the \nbelief that his understanding of ‘I am an ãtmã’ has been lost, and the \nbelief that ‘I am the body’ has begun to prevail, is simply a \nmisconception of his mind.  The belief never actually returns.  Such a \nbhakta with perfect gnãn is conscious only of his ãtmã.  Also, he \nbelieves his ãtmã to be brahm-rup, and that Purushottam Bhagvãn, \nwho is Parbrahm, forever resides in that brahm-rup ãtmã.  In \naddition to this, his belief of Bhagvãn remains forever steady.” \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 249 - \n12.6 Then, Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi asked, “How should a person \nthink of his ãtmã?” \n \n12.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “When the drashtã (the jeevãtmã) focuses on \nthe antah-karan, it becomes unaware of the outer sthul body, and all \nthe vishays related to it.  Then, with the thought that rests between \nthe antah-karan and the drashtã, a person should realise the nature \nof the man, the buddhi, the chitt, and the ahankãr.  A person should \nthen observe the various immoral thoughts within the antah-karan.  \nThen, only when those immoral thoughts end, should a person \nperform dhyãn on Bhagvãn’s murti.  However, as long as those \nimmoral thoughts and desires persist, a person should keep \nobserving them, but he should not perform dhyãn at that time. \n \n12.8 “In addition, when the five gnãn-indriyas of the outer sthul body are \ndrawn towards their respective vishays, a person should think in two \nways:  Firstly, he should think about the vishay towards which the \nindriyas have been drawn.  Secondly, he should think about the \ndrashtã who watches from the organ of the indriya.  Then, when the \nfirst thought of the vishay and the second thought of the drashtã \nmerge into one, his vrutti becomes completely detached from the \nvishays.  However, if he does not think in this way and attempts to \nbreak his vrutti from the vishays forcefully, then the vrutti’s attraction \ntowards the vishays will not be eradicated.  On the other hand, if he \nwithdraws his vrutti by applying this thought process, his vrutti will \nnever again become attached to the vishays.  Therefore, as long as the \nvruttis of a person’s indriyas have affection for the vishays, he should \navoid performing dhyãn of Bhagvãn.  Only when the vruttis of the \nindriyas become stable should he perform the dhyãn of Bhagvãn. \n \n12.9 “Also, when the drashtã is active in the outer sthul body, a person \nshould be absolutely clear in making the distinction that when he is \nactive in the sthul body, he should never look towards the desires \narising in the sukshma body;  and when a person is active in the \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 250 - \nantah-karan, he should become unaware of his sthul body.  Moreover, \nusing the thought which rests between the drashtã and drashya, he \nshould realise, ‘The drashtã and drashya are absolutely distinct’.  With \nthis understanding, a person should assign the features of the body, \nto the body, and the features of the drashtã, which is chaitanya, to \nchaitanya.  Also, childhood, youth, old age, fatness, thinness, birth, \nand death, are all aspects of the body.  Therefore, they should never \nbe thought of as belonging to the ãtmã.  On the other hand, being \nachhedhya, abhedhya, not aging, immortal, full of gnãn, blissful, and \neternal, are all aspects of the ãtmã.  They should in no way be \nconsidered to belong to the body.  Instead, those characteristics \nshould be understood to belong to the ãtmã. \n \n12.10 “These thoughts should not be abandoned as long as desires and \nimmoral thoughts persist in the antah-karan.  Take the example of a \nking:  As long as he is confronted by an enemy, he cannot preside on \nhis throne in peace, nor does he indulge in any pleasures.  Only when \nall of his enemies are conquered, does he enjoy the luxuries of his \nkingdom.  Similarly, a bhakta of Bhagvãn should firmly keep these \nthoughts, as long as the enemies (his mind and indriyas) continue to \ntrouble him.  Only when all the desires of his mind and indriyas have \ndiminished, should he perform dhyãn of Bhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 12 || 90 || \n \n \nSãrangpur – 13 \nLosing Nishchay And Not Losing Nishchay \n \n13.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Bhãdarvã sud 2 [9th September, 1820], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeevã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Sãrangpur.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 251 - \n13.2 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Can a person who previously had \nnishchay in Bhagvãn, but later lost it, really be said to have had \nnishchay in the first place?” \n \n13.3 Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi replied, “If a person has developed \nnishchay in his jeevãtmã, he would not lose it by any means.  \nHowever, if his nishchay is based on the writings in the shãstras, then \nwhen Bhagvãn performs some action that is not mentioned in the \nshãstras, he would lose his nishchay in Bhagvãn.” \n \n13.4 “Hearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj then said,  “In the shãstras, there are \nan endless variety of talks describing Bhagvãn as being powerful as \nwell as weak, as being the all-doer as well as a non-doer.  So then, \nwhich action not mentioned in the shãstras could Bhagvãn possibly \nhave performed, which causes a person to lose his nishchay?  Please \nanswer this question.” \n \n13.5 The munis replied, “No action of Bhagvãn is outside the shãstras.  So, \nwhat is the reason behind a person developing nishchay and then \nlosing it?” \n \n13.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “It is only through the shãstras that a \nperson develops nischay.  This is because the shãstras describe the \ncharacteristics of Bhagvãn as well as the characteristics of a sant.  So, \nonly nishchay developed through the shãstras remains firm.  On the \nother hand, nishchay developed by a person’s own mind, without the \nhelp of the shãstras, eventually dissolves. \n \n13.7 “The shãstras are also the inspiration behind the activities of dharma.  \nThe fact that an ignorant person, who has never heard the shãstras, \nhas been able to follow the disciplines of dharma to this day, in the \nform of making distinctions between his mother, sister, daughter, \nand other women, is due to the shãstras.  How is that?  Well, it has \nbeen passed down through the generations after someone initially \nheard the talks from the shãstras.  From that, it has spread \nthroughout society through successive generations.  Therefore, a \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 252 - \nperson who develops nishchay in Bhagvãn and loses it afterwards has \nno nishchay in the words of the shãstras.  Such a person is stubborn \nand a nãstik. \n \n13.8 “On the other hand, if a person does have nishchay in the shãstras, he \nwould never turn away from Bhagvãn.  This is because the shãstras \ndescribe an endless variety of charitras of Bhagvãn.  So, regardless of \nwhich actions Bhagvãn performs, it will never be outside of the \nshãstras.  Therefore, only a person who has nishchay in the shãstras is \nable to develop unshakeable nishchay in Bhagvãn, and only such a \nperson attains kalyãn.  In addition, such a person would never \ndeviate from dharma.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 13 || 91 || \n \n \nSãrangpur – 14 \nLaziness And Infatuation \n \n14.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Bhãdarvã sud 3 [10th September, 1820], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting facing west on a \ndecorated bedstead on the veranda outside the rooms of Jeevã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Sãrangpur.  He was wearing a black-bordered, \nwhite khes, and had covered Himself with a white chãdar.  He had \nalso tied a white pãgh around His head.  Bunches of yellow flowers \nwere placed above His ears, and tassels of yellows flowers had been \nplaced upon His pãgh.  In addition to this, a garland of yellow flowers \nwas hanging from His neck down to His navel.  A sabhã of munis, as \nwell as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n14.2 Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi then asked a question: “It is said in the \nGeetã that once a bhakta attains the dhãm of Bhagvãn, such as \nVaikunth, he never falls back from it.  But, which flaw causes some to \nfall back?” \n \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 253 - \n14.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj asked in return, “Who has attained the dhãm of \nBhagvãn and then fallen back?  Give me even one example!” \n \n14.4  Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi replied, “First of all, there are Jay and \nVijay, the pãrshads of Bhagvãn who fell from Vaikunth.  Then, there \nare Radhikãji and Shreedãmã, who fell from Golok.” \n \n14.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj then clarified, “Jay and Vijay did fall, but it was only \nbecause Bhagvãn wanted to illustrate the glory of a sãdhu.  If a \nperson insults a sãdhu, like the Sanakãdik, then even if he has \nattained a dhãm like Vaikunth, he can still fall from it.  That is why \nthey fell.  In addition, Jay and Vijay did return to Bhagvãn’s dhãm, \nVaikunth, in their third life.  Therefore, they cannot be said to have \nfallen; it happened because it was Bhagvãn’s wish.  In any case, a \nperson can only be said to have fallen when he never again retains \nany contact with Bhagvãn. \n \n14.6 “Also, when Rãdhikãji fell from Golok, that too was by Bhagvãn’s wish, \nas He Himself wished to incarnate in a human body to uplift \ncountless jeevs and perform kalyãn-kãri actions.  Therefore, if \nsomeone claims that Rãdhikãji fell, then Bhagvãn could be said to \nhave fallen along with her.  That is why she cannot be said to have \nfallen, because it was Bhagvãn’s wish that they both came to earth \nfrom Golok.  So, in this instance, it should be recognised as being the \nwish of Bhagvãn only. \n \n14.7 “Of course, if it is His wish, a mukta may incarnate in a body even \nfrom Akshardhãm.  Moreover, by His will, that which is jad can \nbecome chaitanya, and that which is chaitanya can become jad.  After \nall, Bhagvãn is extremely powerful, and whatever He wishes, occurs.  \nTherefore, no one who has attained the dhãm of Bhagvãn falls back \nfrom it without it being Bhagvãn’s wish.  However, a person who does \nfall, is a worldly incomplete bhakta, who falls during the course of his \nspiritual activities.  Such a person is called ‘yog-bhrasht’.  In contrast, \nthose who have become siddh through vairãgya, ãtmã-nishthã, bhakti \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 254 - \ntowards Bhagvãn, and brahm-chãrya, are equal to the muktas of \nShvet-Dvip.  They never fall.” \n \n14.8 Having explained this, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Now, I shall ask a \nquestion.” \n \n14.9 The munis responded, “Please do ask.” \n \n14.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “In the Udyog-Parva of the Mahãbhãrat, Sanat-\nSujãt Rushi says to Dhrutrãshtra, ‘He who abandons both laziness and \ninfatuation has completely disobeyed Bhagvãn’s mãyã.  In fact, laziness \nand infatuation are mãyã itself’.  Now, we are known to be tyãgi \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn.  If someone amongst us has laziness and \ninfatuation, and if that person is not particularly vigilant in \neradicating them by using the strength of Bhagvãn’s glory, then what \ntype of bliss does such a bhakta experience in this body?  Also, what \ntype of bliss does he attain after he dies?  That is my question.” \n \n14.11 Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi replied, “A person who is a bhakta of \nBhagvãn need not worry too much if his laziness and infatuation are \nnot eradicated by the deep thought of Bhagvãn’s glory.” \n \n14.12 Shreeji Mahãrãj then questioned, “What is wrong with a bhakta of \nBhagvãn who has laziness and infatuation and is vigilant in his efforts \nto eradicate them?  What makes a person who is not so vigilant \nbetter than the person who is?” \n \n14.13 Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi explained, “That bhakta of Bhagvãn \nrelies on the strength of Bhagvãn, not on the strength of his spiritual \nactivities.  That is why he is better.” \n \n14.14 Shreeji Mahãrãj questioned further, “You are claiming that a person \nwho is careless, despite the enemies of laziness and infatuation being \nprevalent in him, is superior.  Well, consider the example of a pati-\nvratã wife.  Due to the fear of her husband, and the fear of preserving \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 255 - \nher pati-vratã dharma, she remains very conscious in her mind, in \ncase she smiles at or touches another man.  Moreover, in her mind \nlies the following fear:  ‘If I behave freely, my husband will think of me \nas an adulteress, and will no longer accept my sevã.  This would be a \nbreach of my pati-vratã dharma’.  Bearing this in mind, she remains \never vigilant.  So, you are claiming that a bhakta who keeps bhakti \njust like the pati-vratã wife and who is conscious in his efforts to \neradicate laziness and infatuation is at fault.  Furthermore, you are \nsuggesting that a bhakta who is not concerned about eradicating \nlaziness and infatuation, like a woman who flirts with any man she \nfancies, and is not concerned about preserving her fidelity, is actually \nsuperior!  Is this because of a misunderstanding on your behalf, or \nwhat? \n \n \n14.15 “Remember, if a person remains careless, then even if he is a bhakta \nof Bhagvãn, the two enemies of laziness and infatuation would not \nfail to hinder him.  For example, when a person drinks alcohol or \nbhãng, then just as a vimukh becomes intoxicated, a bhakta of \nBhagvãn would also become intoxicated and delirious.  In the same \nway, just as alcohol and bhãng in the form of laziness and infatuation \naffect a vimukh, they affect a bhakta of Bhagvãn as well.  However, the \nonly difference between a vimukh and a bhakta of Bhagvãn is that a \nvimukh cannot eradicate these two enemies, whereas a bhakta can \novercome them if he remains vigilant in his efforts.  That is the \nadvantage a bhakta of Bhagvãn has.  Nevertheless, he is not better if \nhe remains careless, even if he is a bhakta of Bhagvãn.” \n \n14.16 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked another question:  “How many elements \nis the sthul body composed of, and how many elements is the \nsukshma body composed of?  Are there equal elements in both, or \ndoes one have more or less than the other?  Please describe the \nnature of these two bodies.” \n \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 256 - \n14.17 Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi attempted to answer the question, but \nwas unable to do so adequately.  Then, all the munis said, “Mahãrãj, \nplease be kind enough to answer this question yourself.” \n \n14.18 Shreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “The sthul body is composed of the \nfive tattvas known as the five mahã-bhuts, such as pruthvi and jal.  \nThe sukshma body is composed of nineteen tattvas:  the five gnãn-\nindriyas, the five karma-indriyas, the five prãns, and the four antah-\nkarans.  Yet, only when the sukshma body is interwoven with the \nsthul body, can all activities be carried out properly, but not \notherwise.  This is because only when the sukshma body, together \nwith the indriyas, joins the sthul body – which includes the organs of \nthe indriyas, such as the eyes and ears – can the vishays of those \nindriyas be indulged in.  This is not possible by the organs of the \nindriyas of the sthul body alone.  Therefore, the sukshma body \ncomposed of the nineteen tattvas is interwoven with the sthul body \ncomposed of the five tattvas (five mahã-bhuts).  That is why the sthul \nbody is also said to be composed of twenty-four tattvas. \n \n14.19 “In the same way, the pleasures of the sukshma body can only be \nindulged in when the sukshma body behaves as one with the sthul \nbody, which is composed of the five tattvas.  That is why the sukshma \nbody, which is composed of nineteen tattvas, is also said to be \ncomposed of twenty-four tattvas.  Moreover, because the sthul body \nis inherent within the sukshma body, when a person associates with a \nwoman through his sukshma body, he ejaculates semen from his sthul \nbody.  Therefore, there is unity between the sthul body and the \nsukshma body during the jãgrat state and the svapna state.” \n \n14.20 Then, the munis remarked, “Mahãrãj, this suggests that the sukshma \nbody is the same as the sthul body.  So, just as there is an effect of \nkarmas on the sthul body, is there a similar effect on the sukshma \nbody as well?  Or is there a difference?” \n \n14.21 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a person has just as strong a belief that \nthe sukshma body is ‘mine’, as he has that this sthul body is ‘mine’, \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 257 - \nthen the law of karmas would apply to the sukshma body just as it \ndoes to the sthul body.  Indeed, it is only to encourage the individual \nthat the karmas of the sukshma body have been said to be \ninsignificant. \n \n14.22 “In comparison, neither the sthul body nor the sukshma body of a \nperson who has no consciousness of his sthul and sukshma bodies, is \naffected by karmas.  This is because such a person behaves only as \nthe ãtmã.  Therefore, a person who has such ãtmã-nishthã, remains \nunaffected by karmas related to the sthul and sukshma bodies.  \nNonetheless, such a person would never physically perform any \nimpure karmas.  Furthermore, he endures any joy or pain resulting \nfrom his prãrabdha.  Even while experiencing them, he believes, ‘I am \nnot the one who experiences.  I am the ãtmã’. \n \n14.23 “On the other hand, a person who is ignorant and who perceives \nhimself with the body, is affected by all karmas related to the sthul \nand sukshma bodies, and therefore he experiences joy and pain \naccording to his karmas.  This is because an ignorant person, while \nexperiencing whichever vishays he indulges in, believes the body to \nbe his true svarup, and feels, ‘I am the one who experiences these \nvishays’. \n \n14.24 “Then, in his final moments, such an ignorant person sees yamduts.  \nHe then becomes unaware of his body and enters a state of \nunconsciousness.  The yamduts force him to leave his body and \ntherefore separate his jeev.  The jeev then receives the body of an evil \nspirit, in which it suffers the torments of Yampuri.  In comparison, a \nbhakta of Bhagvãn possessing gnãn, sees Bhagvãn or His sant in his \nlast moments.  He also becomes unaware of his body and enters a \nstate of unconsciousness.  However, when that bhakta discards his \nbody and becomes separate from it, Bhagvãn grants him a divya body \nlike that of Bhagvãn, with which he resides in the dhãm of Bhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 14 || 92 || \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 258 - \nSãrangpur – 15 \nMugdhã, Madhyã, And Praudhã Gopis \n \n15.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Bhãdarvã sud 4 [11th September, 1820], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda \noutside the rooms of Jeevã Khãchar’s darbãr in Sãrangpur.  He was \ndressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n15.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “I shall ask a question.  There are two \ntypes of bhaktas of Bhagvãn:  A person has such deep love for \nBhagvãn that he cannot bear even a second without His darshan.  His \nlove is very obviously noticeable.  Another bhakta of Bhagvãn \npossesses knowledge of the ãtmã as well as total vairãgya.  He also \nhas love for Bhagvãn, but his love does not appear to be like the love \nof the first bhakta.  Furthermore, although the first bhakta’s bhakti is \nextremely appealing, he possesses neither knowledge of the ãtmã \nand vairãgya, but his bhakti is not as appealing as the first bhakta’s.  \nOf these two bhaktas, whose bhakti is superior, and whose bhakti is \ninferior?  That is the question.” \n \n15.3 To this, Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi replied, “He who has intense \nlove for Bhagvãn is better, even if he does not have knowledge of the \nãtmã and vairãgya.” \n \n15.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then questioned, “With what understanding do you \nsay that he who does not have knowledge of the ãtmã and vairãgya is \nbetter?  Such a person believes himself to be the body, and so \nwhenever he comes upon any of the panch-vishays that comfort his \nbody, he will develop affection for them.  As a result, his love for \nBhagvãn will diminish.  So why do you consider him to be superior?” \n \n15.5 Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi clarified, “I do not consider the person \nwho develops affection for the vishays to be a bhakta who loves \nBhagvãn.  Instead, I consider the person who is like the gopis to be \nsuch a bhakta.” \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 259 - \n15.6 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The gopis were not so naïve.  They \nwere so wise that their wisdom could go beyond the understanding \nof those who do possess knowledge of the ãtmã and vairãgya.  They \nalso spoke as expressively as those who are educated in diplomacy.  \nIn addition, they knew Bhagvãn precisely as He should be known.  \nEven Uddhavji, the wisest of the Yãdavs and Bhagvãn’s adviser, \nbecame overwhelmed when he realised the gopis’ understanding.  \nThat same Uddhavji later said, ‘Bhagvãn has shown great mercy to me \nby sending me to impart gnãn to the gopis’.  He had actually gone to \npreach to the gopis, but upon hearing their words, he himself \nabsorbed in the preaching of the gopis. \n \n15.7 “Though you may say that the gopis were not very intelligent, there \nwere three distinctions amongst them: mugdhã, madhyã, and \npraudhã. \n \n15.8 “Of these, the characteristics of the mugdhã gopis are as follows:  \nThey would often lecture Bhagvãn and say, ‘We have gone out of our \nway doing things for you, yet you do not take even the slightest notice \nof us’.  Furthermore, if they were teased further, they would be upset \nwith Bhagvãn, and speak such harsh words that a person would feel \nthey will soon fall from the path of Bhagvãn.  The gopis who are \ndescribed in this way in the shãstras, should be known as mugdhã \ngopis. \n \n15.9 “Those who are madhyã gopis, would never become angry with \nBhagvãn and would never speak such harsh words.  However, by \nusing their shrewdness, they would use cunning methods to conceal \ntheir selfishness from others and do whatever they please while also \ndoing whatever pleases Bhagvãn.  Therefore, they would not do only \nthat which pleases Bhagvãn.  Furthermore, even if they have to do \nsomething that pleases only Bhagvãn, they would definitely use a \ncunning method to do whatever pleases themselves as well.  The \ngopis, who are described in this way in the shãstras, should be known \nas madhyã gopis. \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 260 - \n15.10 “In comparison, praudhã gopis would do only that which pleases \nBhagvãn.  In no way would they use any cunning methods to satisfy \ntheir selfishness.  Their only wish would be to please Bhagvãn.  \nTherefore, they remain happy with whatever pleases Bhagvãn.  Also, \nthey would never become angry at, or jealous of the other gopis who \nare equal to them.  They would also abandon vicious natures, such as \nmãn and matsar, and remain alert in the sevã of Bhagvãn.  They \nwould never do anything by thought, word, or deed that would \ndisplease Bhagvãn.  The gopis who are described in this way in the \nshãstras, should be known as praudhã gopis.  In this way, there are \nthree distinctions amongst the gopis. \n \n15.11 “Overall, the gopis had extreme wisdom in their understanding, and \ntherefore their love cannot be said to be without understanding.  \nAlso, they had thoroughly understood the greatness of Bhagvãn.  Due \nto the power of that understanding of Bhagvãn’s greatness, the \nqualities of ãtmã-nishthã and vairãgya naturally flourished in their \nhearts.  Therefore, it was due to the power of understanding \nBhagvãn’s greatness that countless kalyãn-kãri qualities, such as \nãtmã-nishthã and vairãgya, were fully developed in the gopis. \n \n15.12 “The characteristics of such a bhakta are as follows:  He wishes for \nonly those panch-vishays (shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh) which \nare related to Bhagvãn, but not for those which are related to \nanything else.  Then, through those vishays, he develops intense love \nfor Bhagvãn.  The love is so intense that even though he does not \npossess the qualities of ãtmã-nishthã and vairãgya, he still does not \nhave any other desire in his heart, except the desire for Bhagvãn. \n \n15.13 “Consider the following example:  When it has not rained, the seeds \nof any types of grass cannot be seen anywhere on the earth.  But, \nwhen it does rain, so much grass grows that even the earth cannot be \nseen.  Similarly, when a person who does not possess the qualities of \nãtmã-nishthã and vairãgya meets with kusang, though he may seem \nto have no desire for vishays other than Bhagvãn, he will begin to \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 261 - \nhave desires for those objects.  Furthermore, his mind will become \ncorrupted, and he will not remember Bhagvãn in his heart.  Instead, \nhe will constantly crave for the vishays.  As a result, that bhakta who \nloves Bhagvãn, but does not possess the qualities of ãtmã-nishthã and \nvairãgya, will feel, ‘I do not have even the slightest love for Bhagvãn’.  \nTherefore, a bhakta who has love for Bhagvãn, but does not possess \nthe qualities of ãtmã-nishthã and vairãgya, is extremely inferior. \n \n15.14 “In comparison, a bhakta whose love for Bhagvãn seems ordinary, \nbut who has the qualities of ãtmã-nishthã and vairãgya, feels, ‘The \nmurti of Bhagvãn is forever present within my jeevãtmã’.  Because of \nthis ãtmã-nishthã, he may not seem outwardly enthusiastic for the \ndarshan and touch of Bhagvãn’s murti.  In fact, he may appear to be \nvery quiet.  However, the roots of his love are very deep.  Moreover, \nhis love is not the type that would diminish due to the influence of \nkusang.  Therefore, this bhakta is superior, and is ekãntik.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 15 || 93 || \n \n \nSãrangpur – 16 \nNar-Nãrãyan Dev’s Tap In Badrikãshram \n \n16.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Bhãdarvã sud 5 [12th September, 1820], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda \noutside Jeevã Khãchar’s darbãr in Sãrangpur.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n16.2 Paramãnand Swãmi then asked a question: “It is said in the \nShreemad Bhãgvat, ‘While residing in Badrikãshram, Nar-Nãrãyan \nRushi is performing tap for the sake of the kalyãn and happiness of all \nthe people in Bharat-Khand’.  So, why is it that everyone does not \nwalk a path of kalyãn?” \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 262 - \n16.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The answer lies in the fifth skandh of the \nShreemad Bhãgvat.  It is said, ‘Bhagvãn is performing tap, but he does \nso only for the sake of his bhaktas, not for those who are not bhaktas of \nBhagvãn’. \n \n16.4 “Nar-Nãrãyan Bhagvãn, who is dressed in the clothes of a tapasvi, \nperforms harsh tap out of extreme compassion, and for the benefit of \nthose people who realise the rarity of attaining a human body in this \nBharat-Khand, and therefore attain the refuge of Bhagvãn and offer \nbhakti to Him.  While performing tap, and gifted with qualities, like \ndharma, gnãn, vairãgya, upsham, divine powers, that are constantly \npresent in Him to a great extent, he dwells in Badrikãshram until the \ndestruction of the universe.  Therefore, even if His bhaktas who live \nin Bharat-Khand may possess the qualities, such as dharma and gnãn, \nto a lesser degree, they flourish greatly in just a short span of time \ndue to the power of Bhagvãn’s great tap.  Then, by the will of \nBhagvãn, these bhaktas receive the darshan of the pratyaksha murti \nof Shree Krishna Bhagvãn amidst the divine light of Akshar-Brahm \nthat is in their hearts.  In this way, due to Bhagvãn’s tap, bhaktas \nattain kalyãn without any difficulties.  However, those who are not \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn do not attain kalyãn.  This is the answer to your \nquestion.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 16 || 94 || \n \n \nSãrangpur – 17 \nDifferences Among Muktas \n \n17.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the evening of Bhãdarvã sud 6 [13th \nSeptember, 1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting facing north on a \ndecorated bedstead on the veranda outside the rooms of Jeevã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Sãrangpur.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 263 - \n17.2 Then Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “As the vision of a person who worships \nBhagvãn becomes increasingly weak, he realises the unlimited nature \nof Bhagvãn, and he increasingly realises the greatness of Bhagvãn.  \nWhen that bhakta identifies himself with the body, he sees Bhagvãn \nas the witness of his jãgrat, svapna, and sushupti states.  Later, when \nhe realises himself as beyond the jãgrat, svapna, and sushupti states, \nhe realises Bhagvãn as beyond them too.  Then, as his vision becomes \nincreasingly weak, he realises Bhagvãn as being far beyond himself \nand understands the greatness of Bhagvãn even more.  Then, as his \nvrutti attaches itself more and more to Bhagvãn with love, his \nupãsanã of Bhagvãn becomes even more firmly established. \n \n17.3 “For example, ants, birds, men, cattle, horses, elephants, large \ncrocodiles, and fish, all drink water from the ocean and become \nhealthy, but the ocean’s level is not even slightly reduced.  Therefore, \nthe greater the capacity of the creature, the more it understands the \nvastness of the ocean. \n \n17.4 “Here is another example:  A mosquito, a sparrow, a kite, a hawk, an \nanalpakshi, and Garud all fly in the sky, yet to all of them the sky is \nlimitless.  However, the greater the strength of their wings, the more \nthey understand the vastness of the sky and their own inferiority. \n \n17.5 “Similarly, a bhakta whose upãsanã is like that of Marichi and other \nprajãpatis, can be compared to the mosquito.  A bhakta, whose \nupãsanã is higher, like that of devs such as Brahmã, can be compared \nto the sparrow.  A bhakta, whose upãsanã is higher still, like that of \ndevs such as Virãt-Purush, can be compared to a kite.  A bhakta, \nwhose upãsanã is higher still, like that of Pradhãn-Purush, can be \ncompared to a hawk.  A bhakta, whose upãsanã is still higher, like \nthat of pure Prakruti and Purush, can be compared to an analpakshi.  \nA bhakta, whose upãsanã is even higher, like that of an Akshar mukta \nin Akshardhãm, is like Garud.  As the powers of these bhaktas \nincrease, they recognise the greatness of Bhagvãn more and more.  \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 264 - \nMoreover, as their own powers increase, their master-servant \nrelationship with Bhagvãn is also strengthened. \n \n17.6 “Also, when the person engaged in worship and identified himself \nwith the jeev, the jeev possessed the luminosity of a firefly.  As he \ncontinued worshipping Bhagvãn, the eight barriers (jad prakruti) \nwere gradually overcome, and he became increasingly luminous – \nfirst like an oil lamp, then like a torch, then like the flames of a fire, \nthen like the flames of a forest fire, then like lightning, then like the \nmoon, then like the sun, then like the fire of destruction, and finally, \nhe became as radiant as the light of Akshar-Brahm. \n \n17.7 “In this way, the luminosity, powers, and bliss of such a bhakta \nconstantly increase.  In the example, the sequence from firefly to \nAkshar-Brahm refers to the difference among the level of muktas.  As \na person reaches a higher spiritual state, Bhagvãn’s greatness is \nrealised to a greater extent, and he attains a higher mukta level.” \n \n17.8 Shreeji Mahãrãj then bid “Jay Sachidãnand” to everyone and stood \nup.  Then, holding a branch of the tamarind tree, He stood facing east \nand said, “From here, the full moon appears like a small plate.  But, as \na person approaches it, it appears to get increasingly large.  Then, \nwhen he comes extremely close to it, it becomes so vast that he is \nunable to see its limits.  Similarly, as obstacles (mãyã) are overcome \nand a person increasingly attains the proximity of Bhagvãn, he \nrealises the unlimited greatness of Bhagvãn.  As a result, his sense of \nservitude towards Bhagvãn is increasingly strengthened.” \n \n||End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 17 || 95 || \n \n   \nSãrangpur – 18 \nSaline Land \n \n18.1  In the Samvat year 1877, on Bhãdarvã sud 8 [15th September, 1820], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting facing north on the \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 265 - \nveranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeevã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nSãrangpur.  He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself \nwith a white chãdar.  He had also tied a white pãgh around His head.  \nA sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \n18.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “If a person with shraddhã comes across \nthe company of a true sant and develops shraddhã in the words of \nthat sant, then all the kalyãn-kãri qualities of svadharma, vairãgya, \ngnãn, bhakti, and wisdom, would develop in his heart, and the vicious \nnatures, such as kãm, and krodh, would be burnt away.  On the other \nhand, if he encounters kusang  and develops shraddhã in their words, \nthen the qualities such as vairãgya and wisdom would be destroyed.  \n \n18.3 “It is like the analogy of saline land.  No matter how much rain falls \nupon it, no grass, or anything else, can grow upon it.  However, if a \nflood were to sweep across the same land, then all the salt would be \nwashed away.  As a result, where there was once salt, there would \nnow be silt.  If the seeds of banyan, pipal, or other trees were to fall \ninto that silt, they would grow into large trees.  Similarly, if a person, \nwho has the previously mentioned qualities of svadharma, vairãgya, \ngnãn, bhakti, and wisdom, firmly rooted in his heart, and who has not \neven the slightest desire for the pleasures of this world, were to meet \nwith kusang, then waters (kusang) would sweep across his heart and \nleave behind silt (worldly talks).  Then, the seeds of vicious natures, \nsuch as kam, krodh, lobh, moh, mad, and matsar, which are dormant \nin the silt, would grow into large trees.  Therefore, a bhakta of \nBhagvãn should never keep kusang.” \n \n18.4 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, “If a person has some svabhãvs and \nhe thoughtfully attempts to eradicate them by associating with a sant, \nthen they can be destroyed.  However, a person’s vicious svabhãvs \nwill not eradicate if he foolishly applies any other methods.  When \nsuch a fool becomes depressed, he either sleeps, cries, takes out his \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 266 - \nfrustrations on someone else, or he may even do upvãs.  He will use \nany of these four methods to try to overcome his depression.  If he \nbecomes severely depressed, he may even resort to committing \nsuicide.  These are the way in which a fool attempts to overcome \ndepression.  However, such methods neither reduce the pain, nor do \nthey eradicate a person’s svabhãvs.  On the other hand, if a person \nwere to attempt to eradicate them with understanding, then both the \ndistress and the svabhãv would be eradicated.  Therefore, only those \nwho have understanding become happy.” \n \n18.5 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj continued with another example and said, \n“Large flames of a fire are extinguished when water is poured over it, \nwhereas even a slight flash of lightning can never be extinguished, \neven though it is in the midst of dense rain clouds.  Similarly, \nregardless of how much vairãgya a person may have, or how much \nlove for Bhagvãn he may have, if he does not have understanding, \nthen like the flames of the fire, all of his qualities will be lost due to \nwater (kusang).  In comparison, a person who has the understanding \nof vairãgya and love is like the fire of lightning.  It may be slight, but it \nis never destroyed.” \n \n18.6 “Then, Nirvikãrãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, if a person has a \nvicious svabhãvs, like kãm and krodh, can they be eradicated, or not?” \n \n18.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Just as a merchant keeps an account of all \nhis transactions, if a person keeps an account of his svabhãvs from \nthe very day he entered satsang, then they can be eradicated.  He \nshould think, ‘When I was not in satsang, I had these vicious svabhãvs.  \nBut, ever since I have entered satsang, they have diminished’.  Then, \nevery year, he should check to see if he has progressed or if there is \nstill some deficiency remaining.  However, a fool does not keep an \naccount like the merchant does.  Therefore, any svabhãvs, which a \nperson may have, can be eradicated if he continuously examines \nhimself while doing satsang.” \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 267 - \n18.8 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “If a person keeps kusang then it is \nobvious that he will develop vicious svabhãvs.  But, why is it that such \nvicious svabhãvs arise even after a person associates with a sant?” \n \n18.9 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “During his childhood, a person does not \nface enemies, such as kãm, krodh, and lobh.  Also, at that age, he also \ntends to have more love for Bhagvãn.  However, when he enters \nyouth, the enemies increase along with the belief that he is the body.  \nDuring that period, if he keeps the company of a sãdhu, who does not \nhave vicious natures and the belief that he is the body, then he will \ncross the ocean of youth.  However, if the youth does not do this, the \nenemies will defeat him, and he will consequently turn vile. \n \n18.10 “However, if an older person is spoilt while doing satsang, it is \nbecause whichever avgun he perceives in a great sant, all return to \ndwell in his own heart.  Conversely, if he perceives the gun of a great \nsant and thinks, ‘Any svabhãvs the great sant exhibits is only for the \nsake of the kalyãn of jeevs.  In fact, He is flawless; but my identification \nof flaws in him is due to my own personal foolishness’, and he also asks \nfor forgiveness for his mistakes, then his deficiencies will diminish. \n \n18.11 Mahãnubhavãnand Swãmi then asked, “Can rãjasi, tãmasi, and sãttvik \nsvabhãvs be eradicated by doing satsang?” \n \n18.12 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “All svabhãvs can be eradicated if a person \ntries to eradicate them.” \n \n18.13 Mahãnubhavãnand Swãmi asked further, “If that is the case, then \ndespite the fact that Durvãsã and others have become muktas, why \ndo they still remain tãmasi?” \n \n18.14 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The qualities, like tamo-gun, which are \nseen in Durvãsã and others, are only present because they choose to \nkeep them.  They feel, ‘If someone is misbehaving, tamo-gun is actually \nSÃRANGPUR \n- 268 - \nvery necessary in order to lecture him.  That is why we keep it’.  \nTherefore, they purposely retain these qualities.  Nevertheless, when \na svabhãv is prevalent in a person, he should have hatred towards it.  \nHe should think, ‘I am a bhakta of Bhagvãn, and such a vicious \nsvabhãv does not suit me’.  In this way, by the grace of Bhagvãn, a \nperson’s svabhãvs can be eradicated if he regards them as flaws and \nstrives to discard them.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Sãrangpur || 18 || 96 || \n \n \n|| End of Shree Sãrangpur Prakaran ||\nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 269 - \n|| SHREE SWÃMINÃRAYAN VIJAYTETRÃM || \n \n \nVACHANÃMRUT \nShree Kãriyãni Prakaran \n \nKãriyãni – 1 \nA Worm And A Bee \n \n1.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Bhãdarvã sud 12 [19th September, 1820], \na decorated, canopied bedstead that had been brought by Jãdavji \nBhakta from Surat, had been placed on the veranda outside the \nnorth-facing rooms of Vastã Khãchar’s darbãr in Kãriyãni.  A mattress \nwith a white, silken cover had been placed upon the bedstead.  A \nlarge, white, cylindrical pillow and red, silken knee-cushions had \nbeen placed on the mattress.  Also, frills of gold fabric were dangling \non all four sides of the bedstead.  Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting facing \nnorth on this beautifully decorated bedstead.  He was wearing a \nwhite khes with a black border, and had tied a white feto with a gold \nborder around His head.  Also, He had covered Himself with a shelu \nwith a gold border.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him.  They were all staring at the \ncharming appearance of Shreeji Mahãrãj, just as chakors stare at the \nmoon with fixed eyes.  \n \n1.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said to the paramhans, “Please begin a \nquestion-answer discussion amongst yourselves.” \n \n1.3 \nBhudharãnand Swãmi then asked, “Does nishchay in Bhagvãn arise in \nthe antah-karans or in the jeev?” \n \n1.4 \nShivãnand Swãmi attempted to answer the question, but was unable \nto do so satisfactorily.  \n \n1.5 \nSo Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The jeev knows through the buddhi, which is \nthe cause of all knowledge, and is greater than all.  That buddhi \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 270 - \nresides in the man, in the chitt, in the ahankãr, in the ears, in the eyes, \nin the nose, in the tongue, in the mouth, in the skin, in the arms, in the \nlegs, in the genitals, and in the anus.  It resides in the body in this \nway, pervading it from head to toe.  The jeev resides within this \nbuddhi.  However, the jeev is not felt, only the buddhi is felt.   \n \n1.6 \n“The following example will illustrate this:  When the flames of a fire \nrise and fall, they do so because of the wind.  The rise and fall of the \nflames are apparent, but the wind is not apparent.  Also, when dung \nis placed in fire, the dung begins to burn.  Then, when it is placed \nwhere there is no wind, smoke begins to rise.  At that time, the rising \nsmoke is apparent, but the wind within is not apparent.  Also, the \nclouds that move in the sky are seen to do so because of the wind, but \nthe wind that resides within them is not apparent.  In this way, \nflames, smoke, and the clouds represent the buddhi, and the wind \nrepresents the jeev. \n \n1.7 \n“What is that jeev like?  Well, the jeev is the knower of the beliefs \nformed by the buddhi, and it also knows Brahmã, who is the cause of \nthe beliefs in the buddhi.  The jeev knows the thoughts of the man, \nand also knows Chandra, who is the cause of those thoughts in the \nman.  The jeev knows the remembrance in the chitt, and also knows \nVãsudev, the cause of the thinking in the chitt.  It knows the ‘I-ness’ of \nthe ahankãr, and also knows Rudra, the cause of that ‘I-ness’.  In this \nway, the jeev perceives the four antah-karans, the ten indriyas, and \nthe vishays, and their presiding devs, who allow a person to \ndiscriminate among those vishays.  The jeev does all of this \nsimultaneously. \n \n1.8 \n“That jeev appears to be in one place; it appears to be as fine as the \ntip of a spear; and it appears to be extremely subtle.  It appears this \nways because it is associated with the buddhi.  But, when that jeev is \nknown as the illuminator of the body, the indriyas, the antah-karans, \nthe vishays, and their presiding devs, it appears to be extremely vast, \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 271 - \nand it appears to be pervasive.  That is when the jeev is not \nassociated with the buddhi. \n \n1.9 \n“That jeev is not known by the indriyas, but is known by assumption.  \nFor example, on seeing a sword weighing two hundred kilograms, a \nperson can infer, ‘The carrier of this sword must be extremely strong’.  \nSimilarly, the jeev inspires the body, indriyas, the antah-karans, the \nvishays, and their presiding devs, simultaneously; therefore it must be \nvery powerful.  This is how the jeev can be known by assumption.”  \nShreeji Mahãrãj answered the question in this way. \n \n1.10 Nityãnand Swãmi then asked, “Mahãrãj, what is the answer to the \noriginal question in what you have just said?” \n \n1.11 Shreeji Mahãrãj clarified, “Well, the answer is that when the belief of \nBhagvãn has developed in the buddhi, a person should realise that \nthe belief has also developed within the jeev.  How does that happen?  \nWell, the belief initially develops in the indriyas, then in the ahankãr, \nthen in the chitt, then in the man, then in the buddhi, and then finally, \nit develops in the jeev.”  This was Shreeji Mahãrãj’s reply. \n \n1.12 Again, Nityãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, how can a person know \nwhen there is belief of Bhagvãn in the indriyas?  How can a person \nknow when there is belief of Bhagvãn in the antah-karans?  How can \na person know when there is belief of Bhagvãn within the jeev?” \n \n1.13 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The belief of Bhagvãn which is in the \nindriyas should be known as follows:  Of all the objects in this world \nwhich are seen, heard, smelt, or touched, some are pleasant and some \nare unpleasant; some give pleasure and some give misery; some are \nliked and some are disliked; some are appropriate and some are \ninappropriate.  If no doubts arise even when all these characteristics \nare apparent in Bhagvãn, that should be known to be the belief of \nBhagvãn in the indriyas. \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 272 - \n1.14 “Furthermore, of the various effects of the three gun (sattva-gun, \nrajo-gun, and tamo-gun), the effect of tamo-gun is laziness and sleep; \nthe effect of rajo-gun is lust and anger; and the effect of sattva-gun is \ntranquillity and self-discipline.  If no doubts arise even when all these \nare noticed in Bhagvãn, then that should be known as the belief of \nBhagvãn in the antah-karans. \n \n1.15 “Due to nirvikalp samãdhi, Rushabh-Dev Bhagvãn wandered crazily, \nkeeping a stone in his mouth.  Although his body burned in a forest \nfire, he remained totally unaware of it.  So, if no doubts arise even \nwhen such a gunãtit state is apparent in Bhagvãn, then that should be \nknown as belief of Bhagvãn in the jeev. \n \n1.16 “For example, ships that travel in the sea carry an iron anchor with \nthem.  When thrown into the sea, if that anchor is immediately \nretracted before it reaches the seabed, then not much effort is \nrequired; it comes out of the sea immediately.  However, if it is \nallowed to reach the seabed before it is retracted, then it comes out \nonly after great effort.  But, if it is allowed to descend gradually, and it \nsettles and lodges itself into the seabed, then it cannot be pulled up \nby any means; it cannot be retracted.  Similarly, when a person \ndevelops the belief of Bhagvãn in the jeev, that belief cannot be \ndislodged in any way whatsoever.”  Shreeji Mahãrãj spoke at length \nin this way, but only a small section has been mentioned here. \n \n1.17 Then, Chaitanyãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, Bhagvãn is greater \nthan the mind and speech, and He is gunãtit.  So, how can the mãyik \nindriyas and antah-karans perceive Him?” \n \n1.18 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “When the jeev – the knower of the body, \nindriyas, and antah-karans – becomes merged during the sushupti \nstate, its indriyas and antah-karans also become merged in that \nsushupti state.  At the time, Bhagvãn inspires that jeev.  When the jeev \nenters the svapna state from the sushupti state, the dream-related \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 273 - \nlocations, pleasures, vishays, and the jeev are all inspired by Bhagvãn.  \nHe inspires them during the jãgrat state as well.  In this way, \nBhagvãn inspires the jeev both when it is conscious of the body, and \nwhen it is not.  Also, from Pradhãn, maha-tattva was formed; from \nmaha-tattva, the three types of ahankãr were formed; from that \nahankãr, the indriyas, devs, five mahã-bhuts, and five tan-mãtras were \nformed; all these are also inspired by Bhagvãn.  Virãt, who is \ncomposed of all these tattvas combined, is also inspired by Bhagvãn.  \nWhen all of these merge into Mãyã, Bhagvãn inspires that Mãyã as \nwell. \n \n1.19 “That Bhagvãn also inspires both jeev and ishvar when they identify \nthemselves with their bodies.  He inspires both jeev and ishvar even \nwhen they reside in the sushupti state, and are merged by Pradhãn \nand are without any identify or form.  He inspires Kãl, which causes \nMãyã and other entities to assume an identity and form, and also \ncauses them to abandon their identity and form.  So, how can that \nBhagvãn be known by the indriyas and antah-karans?  Is that your \nquestion?” \n \n1.20 Everyone confirmed, “Yes, Mahãrãj, that is the question.” \n \n1.21 Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, “The answer to that is as follows: \nBhagvãn does not create and sustain the world for His own sake.  In \nfact, it is said in the Shreemad Bhãgvat: \n \nbuddhindriya-manah-prãnan janãnãm-asrujat-prabhuha \nmatrãtham cha bhavãrtham cha hyãtmane kalpãnaya cha \n \n“This shlok means: Bhagvãn created the buddhi, indriyas, man, and \nprãns of all people to enable the jeevs to indulge in the vishays, to take \nbirth, to transmigrate to other loks, and to attain kalyãn.  Therefore, \nBhagvãn created this universe for the sake of the kalyãn of the jeevs; \nBhagvãn sustains it for the sake of the kalyãn of the jeevs; and \nBhagvãn also causes its destruction for the sake of the kalyãn of the \njeevs.  How is that?  Well, He destroys it to allow the jeevs – who are \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 274 - \ntired as a result of undergoing many births and deaths – to rest.  That \nBhagvãn, who acts in all ways for the benefit of the jeevs, becomes \nlike a human out of compassion.  Then, when the jeevs maintain \nprofound association with a sant of that Bhagvãn, why should they \nnot be able to know Him?  They can certainly know Him.” \n \n 1.22 Then, Bhajanãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, why then does the Vedic \nshlok claim:  \n \nyato vãcho nivartante aprãpya manasã saha \nFrom where speech returns along with the mind without having attained \nBrahm and Bhagvãn. \n \n1.23 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied in a pleased tone, “Well, in that case, the facts \nare as follows: pruthvi resides in ãkãsh, but does not become like \nãkãsh; jal also resides in ãkãsh, but does not become like ãkãsh; tej \nalso resides in ãkãsh, but does not become like ãkãsh; and vãyu also \nresides in ãkãsh, but does not become like ãkãsh.  In the same way, \nthe mind and speech do not attain Bhagvãn.” \n \n1.24 Then, Nityãnand Swãmi raised a doubt:  “Mahãrãj, the Shrutis and \nSmrutis claim:   \n \nniranjanaha paramam sãmyam-upaiti \nHe who is free from the blemishes of mãyã, attains qualities similar to those of \nBhagvãn \n \nbahavo gnãna-tapasã pootã mad-bhãva-mãgataha \nMany who have been purified by tap in the form of gnãn have attained my \nqualities. \n \n1.25 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “What I just mentioned is regarding the \nmind and the indriyas of a vimukh.  However, the mind and indriyas of \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn do become merged with Bhagvãn.  For example, \nat the time of destruction, pruthvi, which resides in ãkãsh, becomes \none with ãkãsh; jal also becomes one with ãkãsh; tej also becomes \none with ãkãsh; and vãyu also becomes one with ãkãsh.  Similarly, the \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 275 - \nbodies, indriyas, antah-karans, and prãns of those who are bhaktas of \nBhagvãn, due to their gnãn of Bhagvãn, become like Bhagvãn.  This is \nbecause Bhagvãn’s murti itself is divya.  So, the bodies, indriyas, and \nantah-karans of those bhaktas become like Bhagvãn’s indriyas, antah-\nkarans, and body.  That is why the bodies, indriyas, antah-karans, and \nprãns of those bhaktas, become divya. \n \n1.26 “Take the following example: A bee captures a worm, stings it, and \nthen buzzes over it.  As a result, that worm – in the very same body – \nis transformed into a bee.  Then, none of its bodily parts remain like \nthat of a worm; it becomes exactly like a bee.  Similarly, a bhakta of \nBhagvãn, in that very same body, becomes divya like Bhagvãn.” \n \n1.27 Shreeji Mahãrãj then concluded by saying, “The essence of this talk \nthat I have given is for both a person with firmness in bhakti coupled \nwith ãtmã-nishthã, and for a person with firmness in bhakti alone, \nprogress is as described.  However, the indriyas and antah-karans of a \nperson with ãtmã-nishthã only do not become divya like Bhagvãn’s \nmurti; he attains only brahm-sattã.” \n \n1.28 Having spoken in this way, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Now, let us stop \nthis talk, as the sabhã has become quiet.  Someone please sing some \npleasing kirtans.”  Saying this, He Himself began to perform dhyãn, \nwhile the sãdhus began singing kirtans. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Kãriyãni || 1 || 97 || \n \n \nKãriyãni – 2 \nA Cursed Intellect \n \n2.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Ãso sud 2 [9th October, 1820], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda outside the \nnorth-facing rooms of Vastã Khãchar’s darbãr in Kãriyãni.  He was \ndressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 276 - \n2.2 \nBy Shreeji Mahãrãj’s ãgnã, the junior paramhans had come to the \nfront of the sabhã and were asking and answering questions amongst \nthemselves. \n \n2.3 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Allow me to ask one question.” \n \n2.4 \nThe junior paramhans responded by saying, “Mahãrãj, please do ask.” \n \n2.5 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then said, “One person’s intellect is such that since \nthe day he joined satsang, he may occasionally perceive avgun in \nBhagvãn and His sant, but it does not persist, and then passes away.  \nDay by day, he may continue perceiving gun and avgun, but he never \nabandons satsang.  This is because he is wise and realises, ‘There is no \nsant like this in the entire brahmãnd, and there is no other Bhagvãn \nbesides his Mahãrãj’.  As he has realised this, he remains firm in \nsatsang.  On the other hand, another person’s intellect is such that he \nnever perceives avgun in Bhagvãn or His sant.  But, even though the \nintellects of both bhaktas are outwardly similar, and their nishchay in \nBhagvãn is also similar, one person continues perceiving avgun, \nwhile the other does not.  What is the fault in the intellect of the \nperson who keeps perceiving avgun?  I put this question to Nãnã \nShivãnand Swãmi.” \n \n2.6 \nNãnã Shivãnand Swãmi then attempted to answer the question, but \nwas unable to do so adequately. \n \n2.7 \nThen, Bhagvadãnand Swãmi said, “That person’s intellect is cursed.” \n \n2.8 \nAt that point, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “He is correct.  That is the correct \nanswer to the question.  In the world, do people not say, ‘He has been \ncursed by someone?’  In the same way, that individual has been cursed \nbecause he may have hurt a great sant, he may have hurt a humble \nperson, or he may not have served his parents.  That is why his \nintellect is the way it is.” \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 277 - \n2.9 \nThen, Bhagvadãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, how can his cursed \nintellect be healed?” \n \n2.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “This piece of cloth which I wear on my \nhead and a thick cloth like a rug cannot be washed with the same \namount of effort.  This is because this thin cloth is cleaned \nimmediately by washing it with only a small amount of soap.  On the \nother hand, to wash a thick cloth, it must be soaked in water for two \nto four days, and then boiled over a fire.  Only then, after it is washed \nwith soap, does it become clean.  Similarly, if a person whose intellect \nis cursed follows niyams only to the extent that everyone else does, \nthen that avgun will not be eradicated.  He should not only remain \nfree of kãm, svãd, lobh, moh, and mãn as others.  Instead, he should \nbecome more free of kãm than others; he should become more free of \nlobh than others; he should become more free of svãd than others; he \nshould become more free of moh than others.  Also, he should go to \nsleep later than others; and he should chant the name of Bhagvãn \nwith a mãlã more often than others; and he should wake up a little \nearlier than others.  In this way, if he follows niyams more intensely \nthan others, his cursed intellect will be healed; otherwise it will not \nbe healed.” \n \n2.11 Then, Motã Shivãnand Swãmi asked Motã Yogãnand Swãmi a \nquestion:  “Do karmas have a form or are they formless?” \n \n2.12 Motã Yogãnand Swãmi replied, “I do not think I can answer that \nquestion.” \n \n2.13 Shreeji Mahãrãj then replied, “In reality, karmas are without a form, \nbut the good or bad fruits which result from those karmas do have a \nform.  Those who claim that karmas have a form are nãstiks.  After all, \na karma is an action, and so it cannot have a form.” \n \n2.14 Shreeji Mahãrãj talked a great deal in this way, but only a small \nportion has been mentioned here. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Kãriyãni || 2 || 98 || \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 278 - \nKãriyãni – 3 \nShuk Muni Is A Great Sãdhu \nA Person Cannot Be Known By His Superficial Nature \n \n3.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on the evening of Ãso vad 7 [14th October, \n1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting facing north on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Vastã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Kãriyãni.  He was wearing a white khes and had \ntied a white feto around His head.  He had also covered Himself with \na white chãdar.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n  \n3.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “This Shuk Muni is a very great sãdhu.  \nFrom the day he began staying with me, his enthusiasm has been \never increasing; in fact, it has never diminished.  Therefore, he is like \nMuktãnand Swãmi.” \n \n3.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then continued, “The affection that people develop \nfor each other is due to gun, and the hatred they experience for each \nother is due to avgun.  However, those gun and avgun cannot be \nestablished from a person’s external behaviour.  A person outwardly \nmay walk like a cat, fixing his eyes on the floor as he walks, but on the \ninside, he may have intense kãm.  On seeing him behave in this way, a \nperson who is not wise would think, ‘He is a very great sãdhu’.  On the \nother hand, someone else may walk with wandering eyes.  On seeing \nhim, a person who is not wise would think, ‘He is a fake sãdhu’.  \nHowever, inwardly he may be extremely free of kãm.  Therefore, a \nperson cannot be judged by his external, physical behaviour.  He can \nonly be judged after staying with him.  By staying with him, his \nactivities can be observed – the way he talks, the way he walks, the \nway he eats, the way he drinks, the way he sleeps, the way he \nawakens, and the way he sits. \n \n3.4 \n“Also, gun and avgun are more apparent during the period of youth, \nbut they are not so obvious during childhood or during old age.  \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 279 - \nSomeone may be spoiled as a child, but as a youth he becomes \nhonourable.  Conversely, someone may be good in his childhood, but \nbecomes spoiled during his youth.  A person who is determined in \nthat he feels, ‘It is not good that I am having these improper thoughts’, \nand who makes an effort to eradicate those thoughts, and who \nremains determined until they have been eradicated, progresses in \nsatsang in his youth.  On the other hand, a person who is careless \ninstead of being alert, will not progress.  So, an honourable person \ncan be recognised from his childhood.” \n \n3.5 \nHaving said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj talked at length about His fondness \nfor tyãg in His childhood.  He then continued, “A person who is \nhonourable does not like the company of immature children from his \nchildhood; he does not have an appetite for tasty food; and he \ncontinuously restrains his body.  Just look, when I was a child, I had \nthe same thoughts as Kãrtik Swãmi, and I felt, ‘I want to eliminate all \nthe parts of my mother – her flesh and blood – from my body’.  So, after \nmany spiritual activities, I malnourished my body so much that if \nsomething pierced my body, water would come out, but never blood.  \nIn this way, a person who is honourable can be known from his \nchildhood.” \n \n3.6 \nThen, Bhajanãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, is it better to maintain \nthis thought in the mind, or is it better to expose the body to tap?” \n \n3.7 \nTo that, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The faults due to the body should be \nknown, and the faults due to the mind should be known.  Of these, \nwhich are the faults of the body?  Well, repeated erections and \nitching of the genitals, excessive movement, rapid movement of the \neyes, smelling many types of fragrances quickly, walking twenty or \ntwenty-five miles quickly, embracing someone with such force that \nhis bones break, ejaculating semen during dreams, and so on – all \nthese are faults of the body, not the mind.  Even if these faults of the \nbody are greatly reduced, lustful desires, as well as desires for eating, \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 280 - \ndrinking, walking, touching, smelling, hearing, and tasting, may \nremain.  These should be known as the faults of the mind.  So, the \nfaults of the body and mind should be distinguished in this way. \n  \n3.8 \n“Then, the faults of the body should be removed by imposing bodily \nrestraints.  Then, once the body is weakened, the remaining faults of \nthe mind should be eradicated by thinking, ‘I am the ãtmã, separate \nfrom desires.  In fact, I am completely blissful’.  A person who practices \nthese two methods – bodily restraint and thinking of the ãtmã – is a \ngreat sãdhu.  If a person has only bodily restraint, but does not think \nof the ãtmã, then it is not appropriate.  Conversely, if a person only \nthinks of the ãtmã, but does not restrain his body, then that is also \nnot appropriate.  Therefore, a person who has both is the best.  \nMoreover, if these two methods – self-discipline and thinking – are \nnecessary for even grahastha satsangis to practice, then a tyãgi \nshould definitely practice them.” \n \n3.9 \nThen, Nishkulãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, can a person remain like \nthat through thinking or through vairãgya?” \n \n3.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person remains like that due to the \ncompany of a great sãdhu.  Furthermore, a person who is unable to \ndo so even with the company of a great sãdhu is a great sinner.” \n \n3.11 Saying that, Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, “If a tyãgi desires to indulge \nin the worldly pleasures which are appropriate only for a grahastha, \nthen he is as good as an animal eating dry grass.  This is because even \nthough he is never going to acquire those objects, he still has a desire \nfor them.  It seems that he has not understood that fact properly; and \nas the saying goes, what is the point in asking the name of a village \nthat a person is not going to visit?  If he does have a craving for those \nobjects that he has given up, will it be possible for him to obtain them \nduring this lifetime?  He can attain them only if he falls from satsang, \nbut not while remaining in satsang.  Therefore, a person who \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 281 - \nmaintains a desire for those pleasures, while remaining in satsang, is \na fool.  This is because whoever remains in satsang is required to \nfollow the dharma of a satsangi.  For example, if a woman sets out to \nbecome a sati but turns back upon seeing the fire, would her relatives \nallow her to turn back?  They would force her to burn on her \nhusband’s funeral pyre.  Also, if a brãhman lady becomes a widow but \ncontinues to dress like a married woman, will her relatives allow it?  \nCertainly they would not.  Therefore, a person who maintains \nindecent svabhãvs while remaining in satsang has not understood \nthis talk.  If he had understood it, such indecent svabhãvs would not \nremain.” \n \n3.12 Saying this, Shreeji Mahãrãj bid “Jay Swãminãrãyan” to everyone and \ndeparted to go to sleep. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Kãriyãni || 3 || 99 || \n \n \nKãriyãni – 4 \nAwareness Of The Jeev, The Buddhi, And The Witness \n \n4.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, four-and-a-half hours after sunrise on Ãso \nvad 8 [15th October, 1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on the \nveranda outside the north-facing rooms of Vastã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nKãriyãni.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of \nparamhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n4.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please begin a question-answer \ndiscussion amongst yourselves.” \n \n4.3 \nGopalãnand Swami asked Bhajanãnand Swami, “In this body, how \nmuch awareness is of the jeev, and how much awareness is of the \nwitness (Bhagvãn)?” \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 282 - \n4.4 \nBhajanãnand Swami attempted to answer the question, but was \nunable to do so. \n \n4.5 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then replied, “The buddhi pervades this body from \nhead to toe.  As a result, it is simultaneously aware of the activities of \nall the indriyas.  The jeev resides within that buddhi by pervading it.  \nTherefore, the awareness of the buddhi is due to the awareness of the \njeev.  Similarly, since the witness resides within the jeev, the \nawareness of the jeev is due to the awareness of the witness.” \n \n4.6 \nNityãnand Swami then asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “Mahãrãj, the witness \ndoes reside within the jeev.  But, realising that a witness must \npossess a form, the question is how can that which possesses a form \nalso be all-pervading?” \n \n4.7 \nHearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “That which possesses a \nform can also be all-pervading.  For example, Agni-Dev possesses a \ndefinite svarup when residing in his lok, but through his powers, he is \nlatent within wood.  Similarly, Bhagvãn possesses a definite form in \nHis Akshardhãm, but through His antaryãmi powers, He pervades the \njeevs and functions as if He possesses a form.  Therefore, even that \nantaryãmi form should be considered to possess a form.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Kãriyãni || 4 || 100 || \n \n \nKãriyãni – 5 \nBhagvãn’s Purpose For Assuming An Avatãr \n \n5.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Ãso vad 14 [4th November, 1820], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a bedstead with a canopy \non the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Vastã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Kãriyãni.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A \nsabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 283 - \n5.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “I wish to ask a question.” \n \n5.3 \nThe munis responded by saying, “Mahãrãj, please do ask.” \n \n5.4 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Bhagvãn assumes an avatãr on earth to \ngrant kalyãn to the jeevs.  But, is He not capable of granting kalyãn \nwhile remaining in His dhãm, without assuming an avatãr?  After all, \nBhagvãn can grant kalyãn in any way He wishes.  Then, what is the \npurpose of Him assuming an avatãr on earth?  Furthermore, if \nBhagvãn can only grant kalyãn when He assumes an avatãr, and He is \nincapable of granting kalyãn in any other way, it would suggest that \nthis is a weakness of Bhagvãn.  But in reality, Bhagvãn is capable of \ngranting kalyãn to the jeevs by assuming an avatãr, and He is also \ncapable of granting kalyãn to the jeevs without assuming an avatãr.  \nThen, what is the purpose of Bhagvãn assuming an avatãr on earth?  \nThat is the question.” \n \n5.5 \nThe senior sãdhus answered according to their own understanding, \nbut were unable to answer Shreeji Mahãrãj’s question adequately.  As \nShreeji Mahãrãj raised doubts to their answers, their answers were \nall disproved.  The munis then folded their hands and requested, \n“Mahãrãj, only you are capable of answering this question.” \n \n5.6 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “Bhagvãn assumes an avatãr for only \none reason:  Having surrendered Himself to the bhakti of those \nbhaktas who have intense love for Him, Bhagvãn assumes whichever \nsvarup the bhaktas wish for in order to grant them bliss.  He then \nfulfils all the desires of His bhaktas.  Since the bhaktas have a physical \nbody, Bhagvãn also assumes a physical body, and showers love upon \nthose bhaktas.  In addition to this, He suppresses His powers and \nbehaves with the bhaktas as a son, or as a close companion, or as a \nfriend, or as a relative.  Because of this, the bhakta may not maintain \nmuch courtesy with Bhagvãn.  Nonetheless, Bhagvãn showers His \nlove upon the bhakta in whichever way He desires. \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 284 - \n5.7 \n“Therefore, the only reason Bhagvãn assumes an avatãr is to fulfil the \ndesires of His beloved bhaktas.  Along with this, He grants kalyãn to \ninnumerable other jeevs and also establishes dharma.  Now, if there is \nany doubt in what I have just said, please speak.” \n \n5.8 \n The munis replied, “Mahãrãj, your reply is most appropriate.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Kãriyãni || 5 || 101 || \n \n \nKãriyãni – 6 \nA Person Who Possesses Matsar \n \n6.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Ãso vad Amãs [5th November, 1820], the \nday of Divãli, a row of oil lamps had been arranged around a stage \nwhich had been assembled in front of the north-facing rooms of Vastã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Kãriyãni.  Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj \nwas sitting on a decorated, canopied bedstead that had been placed \non that stage.  He was wearing a red survãl made of kinkhãb with \ngolden embroidery.  He was also wearing a black, kinkhãb dagli with \nthe words ‘Nar-Nãrãyan-Swãminãrãyan’ imprinted upon it.  Around \nHis head He had tied an orange pãgh with a border of golden threads.  \nHe had also tied a sky-blue coloured feto tightly around his waist, and \ngarlands of yellow flowers were hanging around His neck.  A sabhã of \nmunis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n6.2 \nA female bhakta from the port of Deev had come on that occasion.  \nShe requested Shreeji Mahãrãj to allow her to perform His pujã.  \nAccepting her request, Shreeji Mahãrãj came down from His seat, \napproached the bhakta, and accepted her pujã.  Then, after accepting \nthe clothes, a yellow umbrella, and a pair of wooden chãkhadis \noffered by her, He returned to His seat. \n \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 285 - \n6.3 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “For so many years bhaktas have been \noffering clothes and thousands of rupees worth of jewellery to me, \nbut I have never gone of my own accord to receive them as I just did.  \nAlso, I have never become as pleased by wearing the clothes and \njewellery offered by others as I have just now.  I have become \nextremely pleased upon this bhakta today.” \n \n6.4 \nThe munis commented, “That bhakta truly does have love.”  In the \nmeantime, Dinã-Nãth Bhatt arrived, bowed at the feet of Shreeji \nMahãrãj, and then sat down.  Shreeji Mahãrãj then gave all the richly \nembroidered clothes to him. \n \n6.5 \nMuktãnand Swãmi then asked, “Mahãrãj, by which gun is Bhagvãn \npleased upon a bhakta?” \n \n6.6 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Bhagvãn is pleased with a bhakta who \nbecomes free of kãm, krodh, lobh, kapat, mãn, irshyã, and matsar, and \nthen offers bhakti to Bhagvãn.  But, amongst all of those, matsar is the \nroot of all avgun.  That is why in the Shreemad Bhãgvat, Shree Vyãsji \nhas noted that only the sãdhu who is without matsar is worthy to \npossess bhãgvat-dharma.  As a result, matsar is fainter than all the \nother avgun.  Also, it is extremely difficult to eradicate matsar.” \n \n6.7 \nThen, Brahmãnand Swãmi asked, “What is the method for eradicating \nmatsar?” \n \n6.8 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person who is a sãdhu, and treads the \npath of a sãdhu, will be able to eradicate matsar.  However, if a \nperson does not desire to tread the path of a sãdhu, the matsar within \nhim will never be eradicated.” \n \n6.9 \nAgain, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “What causes matsar?” \n \n6.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “There are three causes of matsar:  women, \nwealth, and delicious food.  But, for a person who does not have any \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 286 - \nof these three, mãn is the cause of matsar.  Moreover, for a person \nwho possesses matsar, the fact that I have given these clothes to \nDinã-Nãth Bhatt, must have led to matsar.  Such a person would \nnever think, ‘The person who brought such richly embroidered clothes \nand offered them to Mahãrãj should be commended.  Mahãrãj should \nalso be commended since He immediately gave them away to a \nbrãhman’.  Such a thought would never arise in the heart of a person \nwho possesses matsar.  Even if someone else gives something and \nsomeone else receives it, a person who possesses matsar burns with \nenvy unnecessarily.” \n \n6.11 “As for me, not even the slightest bit of kãm, krodh, lobh, mãn, matsar, \nor irshyã, enters my heart.  Also, in my heart, I experience a strong \nhatred for the panch-vishays (shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh).  In \nfact, I do not have even the slightest interest in any one of the panch-\nvishays. \n  \n6.12 “Whenever I accept food or clothes, I do so on seeing the bhakti of the \nbhaktas; I never accept them for own physical pleasure.  All of my \nactions, like eating, drinking, and wearing clothes, are for the sake of \nall the sãdhus and satsangis.  If I have the feeling that it is for my own \nsake and not for their sake, then I would immediately discard it. \n \n6.13 “The only reason I keep this physical body is for the sake of the \nsatsangis; besides that, there is no other reason.  Bhaktas such as \nMulji Brahm-Chãri and Somlã Khãchar, who have been staying close \nto me for so many years, know my nature and realise, ‘Besides the \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn, Mahãrãj does not have love for anything else.  In \nfact, Mahãrãj is not affected by anything, just like ãkãsh’.  In this way, \nthose who constantly stay near me know my nature.  I have sacrificed \nmy body for the sake of those who are bhaktas of Bhagvãn by word, \nthought, and deed.  Therefore, in all ways, I am attached to whoever \nis a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  To me, the wealth of the fourteen loks, \nwithout the bhaktas of Bhagvãn, seems as worthless as a blade of \ngrass. \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 287 - \n6.14 “In addition, even those who are bhaktas of Bhagvãn and have firm \nlove only for Bhagvãn, will not find pleasure in the enticing vishays.  \nAlthough they may sustain the body with ordinary vishays, they \nimmediately become miserable by attractive vishays.  Therefore, only \nsuch a person can be considered to be a completely perfect bhakta of \nBhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Kãriyãni || 6 || 102 || \n \n \nKãriyãni – 7 \nVairãgya Due To Obsession \nÃtyantik Kalyãn \n \n7.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Kãrtik sud 1 [6th November, \n1820], a row of oil lamps had been arranged around a stage in front \nof the north-facing rooms of Vastã Khãchar’s darbãr in Kãriyãni.  \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a bedstead that had been placed on \nthe stage.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of \nparamhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n7.2 \nThen, Kãshidãs of the village of Bochãsan asked Shreeji Mahãrãj a \nquestion:  “Mahãrãj, tyãgis follow the path of nivrutti; therefore, they \nare able to keep their vrutti constantly on Bhagvãn.  However, \ngrahasthas follow the path of pravrutti; so, they are plagued with \ncountless worldly problems.  What understanding must a grahastha \nmaintain in order to fix his vrutti constantly on Bhagvãn?” \n \n7.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The grahastha should believe, ‘Just as I had \nparents, wives, and children during my past lives in the cycle of 8.4 \nmillion life-forms, I have the same in this life as well.  In fact, there must \nbe many mothers, sisters, and daughters from many past lives \nwandering around, and yet, just as I do not have any sense of ‘my-ness’ \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 288 - \nfor them, similarly, I should not keep any sense of ‘my-ness’ for the \nrelations of this body either’.  Thinking in this way, if he diverts his \naffection from everything else, maintains firm affection only towards \nBhagvãn, and keeps the company of a sãdhu, then even a grahastha’s \nvrutti can remain constantly fixed on Bhagvãn, just like the vrutti of a \ntyãgi.” \n \n7.4 \nHearing these words of Shreeji Mahãrãj, all the grahasthas present in \nthe sabhã folded their hands and asked, “Mahãrãj, what will become \nof the grahastha who is unable to behave in that way?” \n \n7.5 \nShreeji Mahãrãj answered, “I spoke in reference to a person who, \nhaving eradicated all desires for all objects except Bhagvãn, keeps his \nvrutti constantly on Bhagvãn.  But, someone who is not so strong \nshould abide by the dharma of satsang.  He should also rely on the \nstrength of Bhagvãn and His sant, whose refuge he has taken, by \nbelieving, ‘Bhagvãn is adham-udhãran and patit-pãvan, and I have \nattained Him in person’.’’  After hearing these words from Shreeji \nMahãrãj, the bhaktas became extremely pleased. \n \n7.6 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then asked the sant, “What causes vairãgya to arise?” \n \n7.7 \nThe sãdhus replied according to their understanding, but Shreeji \nMahãrãj’s question could not be answered adequately.  So they said, \n“Mahãrãj, you will have to answer that question.”  \n \n7.8 \nShreeji Mahãrãj explained, “Upon hearing the words of the shãstras \nand sat-purush, developing a fascination that does not diminish once \ndeveloped, is the only cause for vairãgya; there is no other cause.  \nWhoever is fascinated in this way, will develop vairãgya, regardless \nof whether he is tãmasi, rãjasi, or sãttvik.  On the other hand, if a \nperson does not have such an fascination, he will not develop \nvairãgya.  Also, if someone’s fascination diminishes after a few days, \nthen the vairãgya that develops can cause tremendous harm.  How?  \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 289 - \nWell, when he does have the fascination, he renounces and leaves his \nhome.  Then, after he becomes a sãdhu, the fascination that he had \npreviously developed, subsides; but the house he left behind would \nbe in ruins.  Then, like the dog of a washer-man, who is fed neither at \nhome nor at the river, he falls from both paths.  On the other hand, \nthose who have firm vairãgya, attain Akshardhãm.” \n \n7.9 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked another question to the paramhans, in \nan extremely pleased mood:  “What is ãtyantik kalyãn?  Also, how \ndoes a person who has attained ãtyantik kalyãn and siddh-dashã, feel \nin all of his activities?” \n \n7.10 The munis answered according to their understanding, but Shreeji \nMahãrãj’s question was not answered adequately.  So, all the munis \nfolded their hands and said to Shreeji Mahãrãj, “Mahãrãj, you will \nhave to answer that question.” \n \n7.11 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “During the destruction of the brahmãnd, \nthe twenty-four tattvas, which have evolved from Prakruti, are \nabsorbed into Prakruti.  Then, Prakruti-Purush also disappear in the \ndivine light of Akshar-Brahm, after which only the concentrated light, \nwhich is sachidãnand, remains.  The divya murti of Purushottam \nBhagvãn Vãsudev is constantly present in that divine light.  Through \nthat divya murti, He Himself becomes visible to everyone, and \nincarnates on earth in human form for the purpose of granting kalyãn \nto the jeevs.  But, the jeevs on earth who are ignorant fools, claim that \nBhagvãn has mãyik qualities within Him.  In reality, he does not have \nany mãyik qualities within Him; He is forever gunãtit and has a divya \nmurti.  Moreover, it is that very same Bhagvãn, who has a murti and is \ndivya, which the Vedãnt shãstras propound as being nirgun, \nachhedhya, abhedhya, and pervading everywhere.  He has been \ndescribed as being nirgun, in order to dismiss the mãyik view from \nthe mind of the jeev.  That Bhagvãn remains the same during the time \nof creation, sustenance, and destruction of the universe; He does not \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 290 - \nundergo any changes like worldly objects do, and He always \nmaintains a divya svarup.  Having such a firm belief of pratyaksha \nPurushottam, is called ãtyantik kalyãn. \n \n7.12 “A person who has attained siddh-dashã through such belief, \nexperiences the following:  Wherever he casts his eyes – among all \nthe sthãvar and jangam forms – he sees the murti of Bhagvãn as if it is \nbefore his eyes, the same murti that constantly remains in \nAkshardhãm even after the destruction of the body, the brahmãnd \nand Prakruti-Purush.  Other than that murti, he does not perceive \neven an atom.  These are the characteristics of a person who has \nattained siddh-dashã.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Kãriyãni || 7 || 103 || \n \n \nKãriyãni – 8 \nSagun And Nirgun  \n \n8.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Kãrtik sud 4 [9th November, 1820], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda \noutside the north-facing rooms of Vastã Khãchar’s darbãr in Kãriyãni.  \nHe was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n8.2 \nThen, Muktãnand Swãmi asked a question:  “Mahãrãj, the Veds, the \nshãstras, the Purãns, and the historical shãstras, have described the \nsagun svarup of Bhagvãn and have also described His nirgun svarup.  \nSo, how should a person understand the nirgun svarup, and how \nshould he understand the sagun svarup of Shree Purushottam?  Also, \nhow much does a bhakta of Bhagvãn benefit by understanding the \nnirgun svarup of that Bhagvãn, and how much does he benefit by \nunderstanding the sagun svarup of that Bhagvãn?” \n \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 291 - \n8.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The nirgun svarup of Bhagvãn is much \nsubtler than that which is subtle.  It is the ãtmã of all the tattvas, such \nas pruthvi and jal; it is the ãtmã of Pradhãn-Purush, which are higher \nthan those tattvas; and it is the ãtmã of pure Purush and Prakruti \nwhich are themselves higher than Pradhãn-Purush; it is the ãtmã of \neven Akshar who is higher than them.  All these make up the sharir of \nBhagvãn.  Just as the jeev is subtler, purer, and of greater luminosity \nthan the body, in the same way, compared to all the other entities, \nBhagvãn is much more subtle, pure, unaffected, and luminous.  For \nexample, ãkãsh pervades the four bhuts (pruthvi, jal, tej vãyu).  \nMoreover, it remains unaffected by those four bhuts, and the \ninfluences of those four bhuts do not affect ãkãsh.  In fact, despite \ndwelling in those four bhuts, ãkãsh remains absolutely unaffected.  In \nthe same way, Purushottam Bhagvãn dwells in all as their ãtmã.  \nDespite this, He is absolutely unchanged and untainted, and He \nmaintains His own unique characteristics; no one is capable of \nbecoming like Him.  \n \n8.4 \n“For example, even though ãkãsh dwells within the four bhuts, the \nfour bhuts are incapable of becoming unaffected and untainted like \nãkãsh.  Similarly, Purushottam Bhagvãn is the ãtmã of all, yet no one \nup to and including Akshar is capable of becoming as powerful as \nPurushottam Bhagvãn.  In this way, being extremely subtle, extremely \nunaffected, \nextremely \npure, \nextremely \nuntainted, \nextremely \nluminous, and possessing tremendous, divine powers is the nirgun \naspect of the murti of that Bhagvãn.  In another example, if Mount \nGirnãr were to be placed next to Mount Lokã-Lok it would appear \nextremely small.  In the same way, before the vastness of \nPurushottam Bhagvãn, countless millions of brahmãnds, which are \nencircled by the eight barriers (jad prakruti), appear extremely small, \nlike mere atoms.  Those brahmãnds do not become smaller, but \nbefore the vastness of Bhagvãn they appear smaller.  In this way, the \nextreme vastness of the murti of Bhagvãn is the sagun aspect of \nBhagvãn. \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 292 - \n8.5 \n“Then, someone may doubt, ‘In His nirgun svarup, Bhagvãn is subtler \nthan the extremely subtle, and in His sagun svarup, He is more vast \nthan the extremely vast.  Then, what is the nature of the original svarup \nof Bhagvãn, who assumes both of these svarups?’ \n \n8.6 \n“Then, answer to that is that the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvãn visible \nin a human svarup is the eternal and original svarup of Bhagvãn.  His \nnirgun and sagun aspects are the special, divine powers of that \nsvarup.  For example, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn and Arjun sat in a \nchariot and went to retrieve the son of the brãhman.  After crossing \nMount Lokã-Lok, they reached the darkness of Mãyã.  Shree Krishna \npierced that Mãyã using his sudarshan chakra.  Then, reaching the \nlight of Brahm, which is beyond that Mãyã, he retrieved the son of the \nbrãhman from Bhumã-Purush who resides there.  In that situation, \nthe chariot and horses were mãyik and physical, but through \ncontact with Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, they became extremely subtle \nand chaitanya; so, they reached the nirgun Akshardhãm of Bhagvãn.  \nIn this way, to impart subtlety to physical objects is the nirgun aspect \nof Shree Krishna Bhagvãn’s murti. \n \n8.7 \n“Furthermore, that same Shree Krishna Bhagvãn showed the whole \nbrahmãnd, including the eight barriers (jad prakruti) which encircle \nit, in his own mouth to his mother, Yashodãji.  To Arjun, he also \nrevealed the Vishvarup form in his own svarup.  At the time, with the \nexception of Arjun, everyone saw the svarup of Bhagvãn as being five-\nand-a-half feet in height.  Also, when Bhagvãn assumed the avatãr of \nVãman, he initially gave darshan in the form of a dwarf.  However, \nafter he had made Bali give up as much land as could be covered in \nthree footsteps, he increased the size of his own svarup to such an \nextent that one footstep alone covered the seven Pãtãls, with his own \nbody covering the entire sky.  With his second footstep, he covered \nthe seven Svargs and pierced the outer shell of the brahmãnd.  Bali \nRãjã saw this vast svarup of Bhagvãn, but others only saw the dwarf \nsvarup of Bhagvãn. \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 293 - \n8.8 \n“In this way, Bhagvãn’s vastness, which is even more vast than the \nextremely vast, is the sagun aspect of Bhagvãn’s murti.  For example, \nthe sky is cloudless during the winter and summer, but when \nmonsoon arrives, it becomes overcast with innumerable clusters of \nclouds.  With time, these clouds form in the sky and later disperse \nagain.  In the same way, by His own will, Bhagvãn reveals His divine \npowers from Himself in their nirgun and sagun aspects, and also \nwithdraws them back within Himself.  That Bhagvãn appears to be \nlike a human, but no one is able to understand the limits of His \ngreatness.  If a bhakta realises the nirgun and sagun aspects in \nBhagvãn’s svarup in this way, then Kãl, karma, and Mãyã would be \nincapable of binding him, and throughout the day he would \ncontinuously experience wonder in his heart.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Kãriyãni || 8 || 104 || \n \n \nKãriyãni – 9 \nAs Stubborn As A Buffalo \n \n9.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Kãrtik sud 5 [10th November, 1820], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Vastã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Kãriyãni.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him.  \n \n9.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked a question to Nityãnand Swãmi and \nBrahmãnand Swãmi:  “Suppose there is someone who is so unkind \nand stubborn, that once he develops a grudge for someone, he never \nabandons that grudge.  Instead, he continues to remain stubborn like \na buffalo.  Can such a person be called a sãdhu or not?” \n \n9.3 \nBoth replied, “A person who is like that cannot be called a sãdhu.” \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 294 - \n9.4 \nThen, Muktãnand Swãmi asked a question:  “Mahãrãj, there may be a \nbhakta of Bhagvãn who perceives avgun in some other bhakta, and \ndue to that, he develops hatred for that bhakta.  How can he eradicate \nthe perception of that avgun?” \n \n9.5 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person who has the bhakti of Bhagvãn in \nhis heart and realises the greatness of Bhagvãn, would never \nperceive avgun in a bhakta of Bhagvãn, and he would never develop \nan unkind stubbornness towards a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  For example, \nUddhavji had understood the greatness of Bhagvãn, and therefore \nasked for a vardãn:  ‘May I be reborn as any of the vines, or blades of \ngrass, or shrubs in Vrundãvan in order to have the privilege of being \ntouched by the dust of the feet of the gopis’.  Also, Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn told Baldevji that the trees, birds, and deer in Vrundãvan are \nextremely fortunate.  Even Brahmã asked for a vardãn from Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn:  ‘O Bhagvãn!  May I be so highly blessed to be able to \nserve your holy feet as  your dãs, either in this life, or in the life of an \nanimal or bird’. \n \n9.6 \n“Therefore, a person who understands the greatness of a bhakta of \nBhagvãn in this way will never develop a grudge due to a person’s \navgun.  Moreover, a person who understands such greatness never \ntakes into account even minor avgun that are present in a bhakta of \nthe pratyaksha svarup his own ishta-dev.  In fact, a person who \nrealises the greatness of Bhagvãn looks upon even animals, trees, and \nshrubs, which have come into contact with Bhagvãn, as equivalent to \ndevs.  If that is so, what can be said of those people who are engaged \nin the bhakti of Bhagvãn, abiding by the vartmãn, and chanting the \nname of Bhagvãn?  He would certainly look upon them as equivalent \nto devs and would not think unkindly of them. \n \n9.7 \n“Therefore, a person who understands the greatness of Bhagvãn does \nnot develop hatred towards bhaktas of Bhagvãn.  On the other hand, \na person who does not understand such greatness does develop \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 295 - \nhatred towards them.  Therefore, a person who does not realise the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn and His bhakta should be known as being half-\nfallen, even if he is a satsangi.  Only a person who understands the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn and the bhaktas of Bhagvãn should be known \nto be a perfect satsangi.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Kãriyãni || 9 || 105 || \n \n \nKãriyãni – 10 \nChecking The Pulse \nA Sãdhu Can Only Please Bhagvãn By Performing Tap \n \n10.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Kãrtik sud 10 [15th \nNovember, 1820], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in \none of the east-facing rooms of Vastã Khãchar’s darbãr in Kãriyãni.  A \nsabhã of ten or twelve senior sãdhus and five or six haribhaktas were \nsitting before Him.  Shreeji Mahãrãj seemed to have a fever, and so he \nwas warming Himself in front of a coal stove that had been placed \nbefore Him. \n \n10.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj told Muktãnand Swãmi, “Please check my \npulse.  It seems as if there is a slight illness in my body.” \n \n10.3 Then, after checking His pulse, Muktãnand Swãmi said, “Mahãrãj!  It \nseems to be a serious illness.”  Saying this, he continued, “Mahãrãj, it \nseems that the times are tough for the satsangis right now.  After all, \nMahãrãj, you are as vital to the satsangis as their lives, and any illness \nin your body is the very meaning of a difficult period for all \nsatsangis.” \n \n10.4 Hearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “In order to please Bhagvãn, \nNãradji performed severe tap by enduring cold and heat, hunger and \nthirst, for many yugs; and due to this, he was able to please Bhagvãn.  \nIn the same way, a person who is wise deliberately performs tap by \nrestraining his body and indriyas.  Therefore, a sãdhu who is wise \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 296 - \nshould also behave so as to deliberately induce suffering to his body \nand indriyas.  If that is so, why should he wish to relieve whatever \nsuffering comes his way due to Bhagvãn’s wish? \n \n10.5 “Moreover, a tyãgi sãdhu should firmly maintain the following wish \nin his mind:  ‘I do not desire the pleasures of the panch-vishays found in \nDev-Lok, Brahm-Lok, Vaikunth, and other loks.  In this very body, or by \ngoing to Badrikãshram and Shvet-Dvip after I die, I wish to please \nBhagvãn by performing tap.  Furthermore, even if it takes one life or \ntwo lives or a thousand lives, I wish to please Bhagvãn only by \nperforming tap’. \n \n10.6 “Furthermore, the jeev’s kalyãn is attained only by the following \nunderstanding:  ‘Everything happens by the will of Shree Krishna-\nNãrãyan, not by Kãl, karma, or Mãyã’.  In this way, understanding that \nonly Bhagvãn is the all-doer, is the best cause of kalyãn.  Performing \ntap, however, earns Bhagvãn’s pleasure.  Yet even while performing \ntap, a person should keep such feelings as Rãdhikãji and Lakshmiji \nkeep for Bhagvãn when offering loving bhakti.  If a person still \nunderstands only Bhagvãn to be the all-doer, then even if he does not \nperform tap, his jeev overcomes the misery of births and deaths.  But, \nwithout performing tap, Bhagvãn’s pleasure is not bestowed upon \nthat jeev. \n \n10.7 “There is no sinner worse than the person who does not realise \nBhagvãn to be the all-doer.  In fact, he should be known to be a sinner \nworse than a person who has killed a cow, killed a brãhman, \nassociated with the wife of his own guru, or criticised a sadguru who \nis a knower of brahm.  This is because he believes Kãl, karma, and \nMãyã, to be the cause of everything; not Bhagvãn.  In fact, a person \nshould not even stand in the shadow of such persons who are nãstik \noutcasts, nor should he listen to their talks, even unknowingly. \n \n10.8 “Furthermore, by the grace of Bhagvãn, those who are bhaktas of \nBhagvãn may become like Brahmã, Shiv, Shukji, or Nãrad; they may \neven become like Prakruti-Purush; or they may become like brahm or \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 297 - \nAkshar.  However, no one is capable of becoming like Shree \nPurushottam-Nãrãyan.  Therefore, just like a vile person is shunned, a \nperson should immediately shun the company of those persons and \nthose shãstras that disprove the upãsanã of Bhagvãn and break his \nmaster-servant relationship with Bhagvãn.” \n \n10.9 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, a bhakta who serves \nBhagvãn by offering beautiful clothes, jewellery, and various types of \nfood, also desires to please Bhagvãn.  Yet, you are saying that a \nperson can only please Bhagvãn through tap.  Then, what is \ninappropriate about pleasing Bhagvãn through such offerings, \nwithout restoring to tap?” \n \n10.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If the person who is offering bhakti to \nBhagvãn with such lavish objects does so without any desires, solely \nfor the purpose of earning Bhagvãn’s pleasure, then it is all right.  On \nthe other hand, if he is tempted by those objects, viewing them to be \nBhagvãn’s prasãd, and leaving Bhagvãn aside, if he develops affection \nfor those objects, then by indulging in the vishays, he will become \nengrossed in them and corrupted by them – that is what is \ninappropriate.  Therefore, a tyãgi should realise Bhagvãn to be the \nall-doer and strive to please Bhagvãn only by performing tap.  He \nshould also worship Bhagvãn by offering loving bhakti in the same \nway as Rãdhikãji and Lakshmiji.  That is my principle.” \n \n10.11 Then, Brahmãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, please tell us how we can \nbenefit in this lok and in the lok we attain after death?” \n \n10.12 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The principle that I have just explained is \nitself the only means to attain supreme bliss, in this lok and in other \nloks.” \n \n10.13 Then, Gopalãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, in a person’s mind, he may \nhave great enthusiasm to develop the qualities of tyãg and perform \ntap.  But, if some obstacle is encountered in the process, what should \nhe do?” \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 298 - \n10.14 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person who has great dedication in any \nactivity would never be held back, even if he were to face thousands \nof obstacles.  That should be known to be true dedication.  Just see, it \nhas been twenty-one years since I first met Rãmãnand Swãmi.  \nDuring this period, I have come across countless bhaktas who have \nbeen offering countless varieties of clothes, jewellery, food, and \ndrink.  Despite this, my mind has never been tempted by any of those \nobjects.  This is because I have dedication only for tyãg. \n \n10.15 “Furthermore, in this world there are so many widows who, \nfollowing the death of their husbands, continue to grieve.  On the \nother hand, there are also many women who renounce their wedded \nhusbands and engage themselves in worshipping Bhagvãn.  Similarly, \nthere are so many foolish men who mourn the loss of their own \nwives and continues to have desires for other women.  However, \nthere are so many men with vairãgya, who renounce their own \nwedded wives and engage themselves in worshipping Bhagvãn.  In \nthis way, each and every person has a different type of dedication. \n \n10.16 “But, my dedication and principle is just this:  A person should strive \nto please Bhagvãn by performing tap.  Also, realising Bhagvãn to be \nthe all-doer, he should offer bhakti to Him while maintaining a \nmaster-servant relationship, and he should not allow the upãsanã of \nthat Bhagvãn to be violated in any way.  All of you should accept \nthese words of mine as the most supreme principle.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Kãriyãni || 10 || 106 || \n \n \nKãriyãni – 11 \nThe Characteristics Of Love \n \n11.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Kãrtik sud 11 [16th \nNovember, 1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda outside \nthe east-facing rooms of Vastã Khãchar’s darbãr in Kãriyãni.  He was \nwearing a white khes and a white dagli made of chhint.  He had also \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 299 - \ntied a white pãgh around His head, and was wearing garlands of \nyellow and red guldãvadi flowers.  Tassels of yellow flowers were \nalso dangling from His pãgh.  In addition to this, two barbers who \nwere holding torches, were standing before Him on either side.  A \nsabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \n11.2 Then, Sachidãnand Swãmi asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “What are the \ncharacteristics of a person who has love of Bhagvãn?” \n \n11.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person who has love for his beloved \nBhagvãn, will never disobey the wishes of his beloved.  That is that \ncharacteristic of love.  To take an example, the gopis had love for \nShree Krishna Bhagvãn.  So, when Shree Krishna Bhagvãn prepared to \nleave for Mathurã, all of them together decided, ‘We will disobey the \nnorms of family traditions and society, and we will keep Bhagvãn here \nby force’.  However, at the time of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn’s departure, \nthey looked into his eyes and realised that it was not his wish to stay.  \nAs a result, all of them remained far away, because in their hearts, \nthey feared, ‘If we do not act according to Bhagvãn’s wishes, His love \nfor us will subside’.  Thinking in this way, none of them were able to \nutter a word. \n \n11.4 “Then, after Bhagvãn went to Mathurã, even though Shree Krishna \nwas only five miles away, the gopis never disobeyed his wishes by \ngoing for his darshan.  They realised, ‘If we do go to Mathurã against \nBhagvãn’s wish, then the love that Bhagvãn has for us will diminish’. \n \n11.5 “Therefore, the characteristic of love is exactly this:  A person who \nhas true love for someone acts according to that person’s wishes.  If \nhe realises his beloved to be pleased by his staying nearby, then he \nstays nearby.  On the other hand, if he realises his beloved to be \npleased by his staying away, then he stays away; but in no way does \nhe behave contrary to his beloved’s wish.  That is the characteristic of \nlove.  So, since the gopis had true love for Bhagvãn, they did not go for \nBhagvãn’s darshan without his ãgnã.  Only when Bhagvãn sent for \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 300 - \nthem in Kurukshetra did they have darshan of Bhagvãn, but in no \nway did they disobey Bhagvãn’s ãgnã.  Therefore, a person who has \nlove for Bhagvãn would never disobey Bhagvãn’s ãgnã.  He would \nonly act according to Bhagvãn’s wishes.  That is the characteristic of \nlove.” \n \n11.6 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Now let me ask a question.” \n \n11.7 The munis responded, “Mahãrãj, please do ask.” \n \n11.8 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Except for those panch-vishays which are \nrelated to Bhagvãn, a bhakta of Bhagvãn treats all other vishays as \nworthless.  Therefore, he associates only with Bhagvãn.  Now, \nsuppose Bhagvãn were to issue the following ãgnã to such a bhakta:  \n‘Live away from me’.  In that situation, if he keeps a selfish desire for \nBhagvãn’s darshan, it would amount to disobeying the ãgnã; and if he \ndoes not follow the ãgnã, then the love that Bhagvãn has towards \nthat bhakta would not remain.  Therefore, just as that bhakta has \nabandoned the worldly vishays (shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh), \ndoes he also abandon the vishays related to Bhagvãn, or does he not?  \nThat is the question.” \n \n11.9 Each of the munis gave an answer according to his level of \nintelligence, but the question was not answered satisfactorily.  Then, \nthey said to Shreeji Mahãrãj, “Mahãrãj, you will have to provide the \nanswer.” \n11.10 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a bhakta has deep love for Bhagvãn, \ntreats the worldly panch-vishays that are not related to Bhagvãn as \nworthless, and if he is firmly attached to Bhagvãn via the panch-\nvishays, then wherever such a bhakta goes by Bhagvãn’s ãgnã, the \nmurti of Bhagvãn also goes with him.  Moreover, just as that bhakta \ncannot remain without Bhagvãn, in exactly the same way, Bhagvãn \nalso cannot remain without the bhakta.  In fact, He does not leave the \nheart of the bhakta even for a fraction of a second.  Therefore, such a \nbhakta does constantly maintain contact with Bhagvãn in the panch-\nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 301 - \nvishays.  This is because the same panch-vishays that no one can stay \nwithout, that bhakta has considered to be worthless.  Instead, he has \nattached himself to Bhagvãn in the panch-vishays.  Therefore, that \nbhakta maintains a constant relationship with Bhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Kãriyãni || 11 || 107 || \n \n \nKãriyãni – 12 \nDestroying The Kãran Body \n \n12.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Kãrtik sud Punam [20th November, \n1820], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Vastã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Kãriyãni.  He was wearing a white khes and a \nwhite dagli made of chhint.  He has also tied a white feto with a \nbokãni around His head.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n12.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please begin a question-answer \ndiscussion.” \n \n12.3 Then, the munis asked questions amongst themselves for quite some \ntime, where the topic of the three bodies of the jeev (sthul, sukshma, \nand kãran) and the three bodies of ishvar (virãt, sutrãtmã and \navyãkrut) arose. \n \n12.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then commented, “The kãran body is the mãyã of the \njeev.  That same kãran body evolves into the sthul and sukshma \nbodies.  Therefore, all three bodies –sthul, sukshma, and kãran – can \nbe said to be the mãyã of the jeev.  In the same way, virãt, sutrãtmã, \nand avyãkrut can be said to be the mãyã of ishvar. \n \n12.5 “The kãran body, the mãyã of the jeev, is attached so strongly to the \njeev that they cannot be separated by any means whatsoever.  \nHowever, if a person attains the company of a sant, realises the \nsvarup of Bhagvãn through the words of that sant, performs dhyãn on \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 302 - \nthe svarup of Bhagvãn, and takes in the words of Bhagvãn in his \nheart, then the kãran body attached to his jeev is burnt completely. \n \n12.6 “For example, the shell of a tamarind seed is firmly attached to the \nseed.  But, when the seed is roasted over a fire, the shell is burnt and \nthen becomes detached.  It can then be peeled off easily by rubbing \nthe seed in your hands.  Similarly, when the kãran body is ‘roasted’ \nby performing dhyãn and following the words of Bhagvãn, it becomes \nseparated from the jeev just as easily as when a person rubs off the \nshell of a roasted tamarind seed.  However, even if a person were to \ntry a million other methods, he would not be able to destroy the jeev’s \nignorance in the form of the kãran body.”  \n \n12.7 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked a question to the munis:  “During the \njãgrat state, sattva-gun prevails and a person has knowledge of all \nobjects.  In spite of this, when a person hears something in the jãgrat \nstate, it can only be strengthened if he thinks of it in the sukshma \nbody.  However rajo-gun prevails in the sukshma body; and during \nthe state of rajo-gun, complete knowledge is not possible.  However, \nin the sukshma body, when a person thinks about what he has heard \nduring the jãgrat state, it becomes complete knowledge.  How can \nthis apparent contradiction be resolved?” \n \n12.8 The munis collectively attempted to explain to the best of their \nunderstanding, but none could provide an adequate answer to \nShreeji Mahãrãj’s question.  Therefore, they folded their hands and \nsaid, “Mahãrãj, this question can only be answered by you.” \n \n12.9 Shreeji Mahãrãj thereupon explained, “The answer is that the jeev, \nwhich is the kshetragna, dwells within the heart.  The kshetragna \nenlightens the fourteen indriyas.  Of these indriyas, the antah-karans \ndwell extremely close to the kshetragna.  As a result, whatever a \nperson hears is consolidated when he thinks about it in the antah-\nkarans.  After all, the kshetragna is more powerful than all the \nindriyas and the antah-karans, and so whatever it approves becomes \nthoroughly strengthened.” \nKÃRIYÃNI \n- 303 - \n12.10 Having heard this answer, the munis commented, “Mahãrãj, you have \ngiven a precise answer.  No one besides you could have answered \nthat question.” \n \n12.11 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Regardless of how lustful, angry, greedy, \nor rude a person may be, if he listens to these types of talks with faith \nand love, all of his vicious natures would be eradicated.  For example, \nif a man with teeth strong enough to chew raw chick-peas were to eat \nmany sour mangoes, he then would not be able to chew even boiled \nrice.  In that same way, if a person, who is strongly overpowered by \nvicious natures were to listen to these talks with shraddhã, then that \nperson would no longer be capable of indulging in the panch-vishays.  \nMoreover, the mind does not become as free of desires for vishays by \nsubjecting the body to strict vrats such as tapta-kruchhra, \nchãndrãyan, as it does by listening to these talks of Bhagvãn.  In \naddition, your minds must not become stable while performing \ndhyãn or by turning a mãlã as perfectly as they do while you are \nlistening to these talks.  Therefore, a person should listen to the talks \nof Purushottam-Nãrãyan with faith and love.  There is no better \nmethod to stabilise the mind and to free it of the desires for vishays.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Kãriyãni || 12 || 108 || \n \n \n|| End of Shree Kãriyãni Prakaran ||\nLOYÃ \n- 304 - \n|| SHREE SWÃMINÃRAYAN VIJAYTETRÃM || \n \nVACHANÃMRUT \nShree Loyã Prakaran \n \nLoyã – 1 \nAnger \nDeveloping Complete Satsang \n \n1.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Kãrtik vad 10 [30th November, 1820], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead in the residential hall of the paramhans in Surã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Loyã.  He was wearing a white, cotton-padded survãl and a \nwhite dagli made of chhint.  He had also tied a white feto around His \nhead.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n1.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked the munis, “What does ‘Shankar’ mean?” \n \n1.3 \nThe munis replied, “That which gives bliss is called Shankar.” \n \n1.4 \nHearing this answer, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Last night, an hour or two \nbefore sunrise, Shivji granted me his darshan in a dream.  He was \nseated on the big, powerful Nandishvar.  His body was of a large \nbuild, and he had thick, matted hair; he appeared to be \napproximately forty years of age.  Along with Shivji was Pãrvati, who \nwas wearing all white clothes.  Shivji, like a great sãdhu, appeared \ntranquil, and he showed great love towards me.  However, I did not \nfeel love for him.  This is because I believe, ‘Shiv is a dev that is full of \ntamo-gun, whereas I worship Shree Krishna-Nãrãyan who is the \nincarnation of tranquillity’.  Therefore, I do not have much love for \ndevs like Brahmã, Shiv, and Indra, who have rajo-gun and tamo-gun.  \nMoreover, I have much hatred towards anger; I do not like angry men \nor angry devs.  Nonetheless, why do I respect Shivji?  I do so because \nhe is a tyãgi, a yogi, and a great bhakta of Bhagvãn. \nLOYÃ \n- 305 - \n1.5 \n“What is anger like?  Well, it is like a rabid dog.  If the saliva of a rabid \ndog touches a man or an animal, then they suffer and die, just like the \nconstantly barking rabid dog.  Similarly, a person infected by saliva in \nthe form of anger, suffers like a rabid dog, and falls from the path of a \nsãdhu. \n \n1.6 \n“Furthermore, just like a butcher, an Arab, a cruel soldier, a tiger, a \nleopard, and a black snake frighten everyone and kill some, similarly, \nanger frightens all and takes the life of some.  If such anger arises in a \nsãdhu, it appears very unsuitable; after all, a sãdhu should be calm.  \nBut, if anger were to arise, that sãdhu would appear cruel to others.  \nAt that time, the sãdhu’s appearance would change since anger itself \nis ugly.  Therefore, anger makes a person appear ugly.” \n \n1.7 \nThen, Shuk Muni asked, “Mahãrãj, if a slight trace of anger arises but \nis then suppressed, is such anger disruptive, or not?” \n \n1.8 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a snake were to appear in this sabhã at \nthis moment, then even if it does not bite anyone, everyone would \nstill have to rise and scatter; there would be panic in everyone’s \nheart.  Furthermore, if a tiger were to come and roar at the outskirts \nof the village, then even if it does not harm anyone, all would feel \nterror within, and no one would come out of their homes.  Similarly, \neven if a trace of anger were to arise, it would still be a source of \nextreme misery.” \n \n1.9 \nThen, Nãnã Nirmanãnand Swãmi asked, “By what means can kãm be \ntotally uprooted?” \n \n1.10 To this, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Kãm is uprooted if a person has \nextremely firmly realised himself to be the ãtmã; and he firmly \nfollows the panch-vartmãn, including the vow of the eight types of \nbrahm-chãrya; and he thoroughly understands the greatness of \nBhagvãn.  However, even after the roots of kãm have been eradicated, \nLOYÃ \n- 306 - \na person should not deviate from brahm-chãrya and other niyams in \nany ways.  However, the method for totally uprooting even the most \nvicious form of kãm is to fully understand the greatness of Bhagvãn.” \n \n1.11 Then, Bhajanãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, what are the \ncharacteristics of the three levels of vairãgya – kanishth, madhyam, \nand uttam?” \n \n1.12 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person with the kanishth vairãgya is pure \nwhile strictly following the niyams related to the tyãg of women as \ndescribed in the Dharma-Shãstras.  But, if he were to see a women’s \nbody, then his would get attached to that body, and he would not \nremain stable.  Such a person can be considered to be a person with \nthe kanishth vairãgya. \n \n1.13 “If a person with a madhyam vairãgya were to see a naked women, \nno disturbance would arise in his mind, just as he would not be \ndisturbed by seeing naked animals.  Moreover, his mind would not \nbecome attached to that woman.  Such a person can be considered to \nbe a person with the madhyam vairãgya. \n \n1.14 “Now, if a person with the uttam vairãgya were to come across \nwomen and other worldly objects, even in solitude, he would not be \ntempted.  Such a person can be considered to be a person with the \nuttam vairãgya.” \n \n1.15 Then, Bhajanãnand Swãmi asked again, “What are the characteristics \nfor the three levels of Bhagvãn’s gnãn – kanishth, madhyam, and \nuttam?” \n \n1.16 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person with the kanishth gnãn initially \ndevelops the nishchay in Bhagvãn upon seeing His powers.  However, \nwhen such powers are not seen in Him, or when nothing unpleasant \nhappens to an evil person who slanders Bhagvãn, then his nishchay \nLOYÃ \n- 307 - \nwould not remain.  Such a person can be described to be a person \nwith the kanishth gnãn. \n \n1.17 “If a person with a madhyam gnãn were to see pure and impure \nhuman actions of Bhagvãn, he would be deceived by them, and his \nnishchay in Bhagvãn would not remain.  Such a person can be \ndescribed to be a person with the madhyam gnãn. \n \n1.18 “A person with the uttam gnãn, would not be deceived even after \nseeing any type of pure or impure actions performed by Bhagvãn, \nand his nishchay would not diminish.  Moreover, even if the person \nwho initially convinced him of Bhagvãn were to say, ‘He is not \nBhagvãn’, he would feel, ‘This person must be mad’.  Such a person can \nbe described to be a person with the uttam gnãn. \n \n1.19 “Of these, the person with the kanishth gnãn becomes siddh after \ncountless lives; the person with a madhyam gnãn becomes siddh after \ntwo or three lives; and the person with the uttam gnãn becomes \nsiddh in the same life.”  Shreeji Mahãrãj replied in this way. \n \n1.20 Then, Motã Shivãnand Swãmi asked, “Despite having complete \nnishchay in Bhagvãn, why does a person not feel fulfilled within?” \n \n1.21 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person whose antah-karans burns due to \nenemies, such as of kãm, krodh, lobh, svãd, sneh, and mãn, would not \nbelieve himself to be fulfilled – even if he does have nishchay in \nBhagvãn.” \n \n1.22 Then, Nityãnand Swãmi asked, “What is the method for overcoming \nthese enemies?” \n \n \n \n1.23 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The enemies are overcome only if a person \nremains alert to harshly punish them.  Just as Dharma-Rãj remains \nready, day and night, to beat sinners with a stick, similarly, if the \nLOYÃ \n- 308 - \nindriyas behave immorally, then the indriyas should be punished; and \nif the antah-karans behave immorally, then the antah-karans should \nbe punished.  The indriyas should be punished by imposing upon \nthem the kruchhra chãndrãyan and other vrats, and the antah-karans \nshould be punished through a thought process.  As a result, those \nenemies, like kãm and krodh, would be defeated.  Then, by having \nnishchay in Bhagvãn, a person would feel himself to be completely \nfulfilled.” \n \n1.24 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Who can be said to have developed \ncomplete satsang?” \n \n1.25 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “First of all, such a person has extremely \nfirmly realised himself to be the ãtmã.  Also, he believes his ãtmã to \nbe absolutely detached from the body, the indriyas, and the antah-\nkarans; he does not believe the actions of the body and indriyas to be \nhis own.  Despite this, he does not permit even a slight lapse in \nfollowing the panch-vartmãn.  Moreover, even though he himself \nbehaves as brahm-svarup, he does not abandon his feeling of \nservitude towards Purushottam Bhagvãn; he faithfully worships \nBhagvãn while maintaining a master-servant relationship with Him.  \nFurthermore, he realises the pratyaksha murti of Bhagvãn to be \nabsolutely unaffected, like ãkãsh. \n \n1.26  “That ãkãsh is interwoven with and pervades the other four bhuts; \nand the actions of the other four bhuts occur within ãkãsh.  Similarly, \ndespite performing pure and impure actions, the pratyaksha Shree \nKrishna-Nãrãyan remains unaffected, just like ãkãsh.  Also, such a \nperson realises the countless powers of this Bhagvãn as follows: ‘This \nBhagvãn appears to be human for the kalyãn of the jeevs.  But, in fact, \nHe is the creator, preserver, and destroyer of countless brahmãnds.  He \nis the lord of Golok, Vaikunth, Shvet-Dvip, Brahmpur, and other dhãms.  \nHe is also the lord of all the countless akshar-rup muktas’.  With this \nunderstanding of Bhagvãn’s greatness, he devoutly engages in \nLOYÃ \n- 309 - \nvarious forms of bhakti, and in listening to the talks of Bhagvãn.  He \nalso serves Bhagvãn’s bhaktas.  When a person behaves in this way, \nhis satsang can be said to be complete.” \n \n1.27 Nãnã Shivãnand Swãmi then asked, “At times, a person understands \nthe greatness of a bhakta of Bhagvãn extremely well, but at other \ntimes, he does not understand it so well.  What is the reason for this?” \n \n1.28 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A sant follows the path of dharma.  \nWhen he sees a person treading the path of adharma, he lectures that \nperson.  As a result, a person who identifies himself with the body \nwill not know how to accept the advice positively and, in return, will \nperceive avgun in the sant, and will have hatred towards the sant.  \nTherefore, a person understands the greatness of a sant as long as he \nis not lectured by him.  Even when that person is given beneficial \nadvice that may pain him, he perceives avgun in the sant, and does \nnot retain that understanding of the sant’s greatness. \n \n1.29 “A person who perceives avgun in a sant, is unable to become pure by \nany form of prãyshchit.  In fact, release from the sins, such as lust, is \npossible, but release from the sin of insulting a sant is not possible.  \nFor example, if a person contracts tuberculosis, no medicine would \nbe able to cure the disease; he would definitely die.  Similarly, a \nperson who perceives avgun in a sant should be known as having \ntuberculosis; he will certainly fall from satsang sometime in the \nfuture.  Furthermore, even if a person’s hands, feet, nose, eyes, \nfingers, and other body parts are severed, he still cannot be described \nas dead.  However, when the head is severed from the body, he is \ndescribed as dead.  Similarly, a person who perceives avgun in a \nbhakta of Bhagvãn, has had his head severed.  If he lapses in \nfollowing other vartmãn, then his limbs can be said to be severed – he \nwill still live.  That is, he will survive in satsang.  But, a person who \nhas perceived avgun in a sant will certainly, at some time, fall from \nsatsang.  He should be known to have had his head severed.” \nLOYÃ \n- 310 - \n1.30 Then, Bhagvadãnand Swãmi asked, “If a person has perceived avgun \nin a bhakta, is there any method to apologise for it, or not?” \n \n1.31 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “There is a solution, but it is extremely \ndifficult; a person who has intense shraddhã can do it.  When avgun \nare perceived in a sant, a person should think, ‘I have committed a \ngreat sin by perceiving avgun in a brahm-svarup bhakta of Bhagvãn’.  \nFrom such thoughts, he will feel intense regret in his heart.  As a \nresult of such regret, while eating, he will be unable to distinguish \nbetween tasty and tasteless food, and at night he will be unable to \nsleep.  As long as the avgun of the sant is not removed from the \nperson’s heart, he will continue to experience extreme guilt, just like \na fish will suffer without water. \n \n1.32 “On the other hand, when he intensely perceives gun in that sant, \nthen if that sant has been hurt in any way, he would please him with \nabsolute humbleness.  If this type of thought remains in a person’s \nheart, then even if he has perceived avgun in that sant, they would \nstill be overcome, and he would not fall from satsang.  Apart from \nthat, there is no other solution; this is the only solution.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 1 || 109 || \n \n \nLoyã – 2 \nFaith, Gnãn, Courage, Or Love \n \n2.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Kãrtik vad 11 [1st December, 1820], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting facing south on a \ndecorated bedstead in Surã Khãchar’s darbãr in Loyã.  He was \nwearing a red, kinkhãb survãl and a black, kinkhãb dagli with the \nword ‘Nar-Nãrãyan’ imprinted upon it.  Around His head, he had tied \na sky-blue coloured feto with golden threads along the edges, from a \ntown called Burãnpur.  He had also tied an orange feto around His \nLOYÃ \n- 311 - \nwaist.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him.  Muktãnand Swãmi and other paramhans \nwere singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a dukad, sarodã, satãr, \nand manjirã. \n \n2.2 \nAfter the singing had concluded, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “O paramhans, \nplease listen.  I wish to ask you a question.” \n \n2.3 \nThe munis said, “Mahãrãj, please ask.” \n \n2.4 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “In this satsang, when does a bhakta \nbecome free from the fear of death and become convinced of his own \nkalyãn in this very life?” \n \n2.5 \nMuktãnand Swãmi replied as best as he could, but was unable to give \na precise answer to Shreeji Mahãrãj’s question.  So, the other \nparamhans requested, “Mahãrãj, you will have to answer that \nquestion.” \n \n2.6 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then began, “While you were singing kirtans, I \nthought about this.  In my mind, I feel that there are four types of \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn who no longer fear death and who feel \ncompletely fulfilled.  These four types are:  first, a person who has \nfaith; second, a person with gnãn; third, a person with courage; and \nfourth, a person with love.  These four types of bhaktas do not fear \ndeath, and they feel fulfilled while still alive. \n \n2.7 \n“I shall now describe the characteristics of these four types of \nbhaktas.  A bhakta who has faith, has established absolute faith in the \nwords of Bhagvãn and His sant.  Therefore, by the strength of his \nfaith in Bhagvãn, he does not fear death.  Also, he believes, ‘I have \nattained the pratyaksha Purushottam Bhagvãn, and therefore I am \nfulfilled’. \n \nLOYÃ \n- 312 - \n2.8 \n“A bhakta with gnãn, has the strength of ãtmã-gnãn, and believes, ‘I \nam brahm-svarup and a bhakta of Bhagvãn’.  Therefore, he too does \nnot fear death. \n \n2.9 \n“All the indriyas and antah-karans tremble with fear before a bhakta \nwho has courage.  Also, he is not afraid of anyone.  So, he does not \ndisobey any of Bhagvãn’s ãgnã in any way.  As a result, he believes \nhimself to be fulfilled and does not have even the slightest fear of \ndeath. \n \n2.10 “The fourth, who has love, has the nature of a pati-vratã wife.  The \nvrutti of a pati-vratã wife is not drawn to anyone except her own \nhusband, and she has love only for her husband.  Similarly, this \nbhakta of Bhagvãn, like a pati-vratã, has love only for his master, \nBhagvãn.  As a result, he believes himself to be fulfilled and does not \nhave even the slightest fear of death. \n \n2.11 “Out of these four types of characteristics, even if only one is \npredominant and the other three are minor, a person still overcomes \nthe fear of births and deaths.  But if a person does not have any one of \nthe four, then his fear of death is not overcome.” \n \n2.12 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked all the paramhans and other \nbhaktas, “Of these four, please declare which characteristic is \npredominant within you.”  So, all the paramhans and bhaktas \ndescribed whichever characteristic was predominant within them.  \nHearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj was very pleased. \n \n2.13 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, “Of these four types, all those who \nhave the characteristic of courage may come near and bow down at \nmy feet.”  Those who had the characteristic of courage, placed Shreeji \nMahãrãj’s holy feet on their chests and bowed down before Him. \n \n2.14 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Those who wish to ask a question, please \nask.” \nLOYÃ \n- 313 - \n2.15 Brahmãnand Swãmi then asked, “That which is the cause should be \ngreater than its effect.  Why, then does a large tree arise from the \nsmall seed of a banyan tree?” \n \n2.16 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A cause may be small and subtle, yet it is \nstill capable of producing a vast effect – that is the very greatness of \nthe cause.  For example, the entities evolved from Mul-Prakruti – the \ncountless Pradhãns – occupy an immense region, whereas the cause – \nMul-Prakruti – has the svarup of a female.  In the same way, smell, \nwhich is the cause of pruthvi, is subtle, whereas the entity evolved \nfrom it, pruthvi, is large.  Similarly, ãkãsh and the other four bhuts \noccupy a vast area, but their causes, such as sound and touch, are \nsubtle.  Therefore, the cause may be small, but it still has the ability to \nproduce a vast effect; this is its capability. \n \n2.17 “For example, Agni-Dev possesses a svarup like that of a man; and his \nsize is like that of a man; but his effect (flames of fire) is large.  \nSimilarly, the svarup of Varun-Dev is the size of a man, but his effect \n(water) is very abundant.  Also, the svarup of Surya is seated in a \nchariot like a man, but his effect – light – pervades the entire \nbrahmãnd.  In the same way, the cause of all, Shree Purushottam-\nNãrãyan is the size of a man, yet He is the cause of countless millions \nof brahmãnds.  But, a person who is a fool thinks, ‘If the effect is this \nbig, then the cause must be so much bigger!’  Actually, this is the \nunderstanding of a fool. \n \n2.18 “Bhagvãn, who is the cause of all, appears like a human being; yet by \nHis extraordinary powers, He is able to create countless millions of \nbrahmãnds from His body and is able to absorb them back into \nHimself.  For example, Agni, Varun, and Surya appear vast in the form \nof their effects, but they withdraw their effect back within \nthemselves, and only they remain.  In the same way, within each and \nevery hair of Bhagvãn, countless brahmãnds, each composed of the \neight barriers (jad prakruti) and fourteen loks appear as mere atoms.  \nLOYÃ \n- 314 - \nIn this way, the cause is magnificent and full of greatness.  So, a \nperson who is wise realises, ‘Bhagvãn appears like a human, but, in \nfact, He is the cause of all and the creator of all; He is all-powerful’.” \n \n2.19 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj returned to go to sleep. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 2 || 110 || \n \n \nLoyã – 3 \nNishchay In Bhagvãn And The Knowledge Of His Greatness \n \n3.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Kãrtik vad 13 [3rd December, \n1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in Surã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Loyã.  He was wearing a white dagli made of \nchhint and a white, cotton-padded survãl.  He had also tied a white \nfeto around His head, and covered Himself with a white pachhedi.  A \nsabhã of munis, as well as satsangis from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n3.2 \nThen, Bhagvadãnand Swãmi and Shivãnand Swãmi asked Shreeji \nMahãrãj, “What are the characteristics of a person who has nishchay \nin Bhagvãn and His sant coupled with the knowledge of their \ngreatness?” \n \n3.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “What would a person who has nishchay in \nBhagvãn and His sant coupled with the knowledge of their greatness \nnot do for the sake of Bhagvãn and His sant?  For them, he would \nleave his family, give up any fear of public ridicule, give up a \nkingdom, give up pleasures, give up wealth, leave his wife, and in the \ncase of a woman, she would leave her husband.” \n \n3.4 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj narrated the stories of the following bhaktas:  \nRajput Galuji of the village Dadusar; Kushal-Kunvar-Bãi of \nDharmapur; Parvat-Bhãi; Rãjbai; Jeevu-Bã; Lãdu-Bã; Motã Rãmbai; \nLOYÃ \n- 315 - \nDãdã Khãchar; Mãnchã Bhakta; Mulji Brahm-Chãri; Lãdhi-Bãi and \nMãtãji of Bhuj; Muktãnand Swãmi; Sãmat Patel, an Ãhir from the \nVãlãk region; Mulji and Krishnaji of the village Mankuvã; the two \nKãthi bhatkas of the village Gundãli in the Vãlãk region; and other \nsatsangis.  Mahãrãj described in detail whatever they had done for \nthe sake of Bhagvãn and His sant. \n \n3.5 \nThen, He added, “A person who has nishchay in Bhagvãn coupled \nwith knowledge of His greatness, never disobeys the words of \nBhagvãn; he does as Bhagvãn says.”  Having said this, He asked, \n“What was my nature like?  Well, I was such a tyãgi that I could stay \nin one place as long as the time interval between the morning and \nevening milking of cows, not any longer.  I had intense vairãgya.  \nMoreover, I had deep love for Rãmãnand Swãmi.  Therefore, when \nSwãmi sent a message from the city of Bhuj via Mayãram Bhatt, \nsaying, ‘If you desire to stay in satsang, you will have to stay by \nembracing its pillar’.  I literally embraced a pillar.  Seeing this, \nMayãrãm Bhatt said, ‘You should live according to Muktãnand Swãmi \nfor nine months.  So, a person who has the previously mentioned \nnishchay in Bhagvãn and His sant can also be known by this \ncharacteristic.”  Shreeji Mahãrãj then narrated the stories of Sundarji \nSuthãr and Dosã Vãniyã. \n \n3.6 \nAfter mentioning that a person who has such nishchay in Bhagvãn \nand His sant has constant enthusiasm, Shreeji Mahãrãj narrated the \nstory of Rãnã Rãjgar. \n \n3.7 \nNext, Shreeji Mahãrãj narrated the story of Prahlãd:  “Prahlãd said to \nNrusinhji, ‘Mahãrãj, I am not afraid of this terrifying svarup of yours.  \nMoreover, I do not consider your protection of me as true protection.  \nInstead, when you save me from my enemy’s army (the indriyas), I shall \nconsider that to be true protection’.  Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvãn \nwould not be overjoyed if Bhagvãn were to protect him physically; \nLOYÃ \n- 316 - \nand he would not be disappointed if he were not protected.  Instead, \nhe would remain carefree and continue to worship Bhagvãn. \n \n3.8 \n“Moreover, he would intensely understand the greatness of Bhagvãn \nand His sant.”  Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj narrated the story of the old \nlady from the village Kathlãl. \n \n3.9 \nContinuing, He said, “Even if such a bhakta – with nishchay in \nBhagvãn and His sant coupled with the knowledge of their greatness \n– were to die painfully; or if a tiger were to devour him; or if a snake \nwere to bite him; or if a weapon were to strike him; or if he were to \ndrown in water; or if he were to die in any other horrific way; he \nwould still believe, ‘A bhakta of Bhagvãn never suffers from an \nunpleasant outcome; he will certainly attain the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  On \nthe other hand, even if a vimukh were to die naturally and were to be \ncremated in a funeral pyre with sandalwood and the full funeral rites, \nhe will certainly go to Yampuri’.  He would understand the difference \nbetween the two extremely clearly. \n \n310 “So, a person who develops such firm belief in his heart should be \nknown as having nishchay in Bhagvãn and His sant coupled with the \nknowledge of their greatness.  A person with such nishchay will \ndefinitely reach Brahm-Mahol; he would not reside in any other \nlower dhãm.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 3 || 111 || \n \n \nLoyã – 4 \nA Person With Doubts \n \n4.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Kãrtik vad 14 [4th December, 1820], \nthree hours after sunrise, Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was \nsitting in Surã Khãchar’s darbãr in Loyã.  He was wearing a white \nLOYÃ \n- 317 - \nsurvãl and a white dagli made of chhint.  He had also tied a white \npãgh around His head.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n4.2 \nThen, Akhandãnand Swãmi asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “There are \ncountless millions of brahmãnds.  In those brahmãnds, does the murti \nof Bhagvãn appear the same as the murti in this brahmãnd at this \npresent time, or not?” \n \n4.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Bhagvãn always resides in His Akshardhãm.  \nFrom the countless Pradhãn-Purush pairs that evolve from Mul-Mãyã, \ncountless millions of brahmãnds evolve.  Then, for the sake of His \nbhaktas, while still residing at one location in His Akshardhãm, and \nby His own wish, that Bhagvãn appears in countless svarups in the \ncountless millions of brahmãnds.” \n \n4.4 \nAgain, Akhandãnand Swãmi asked, “Shree Krishna-Nãrãyan always \nhas a human svarup, and the svarup of Bhagvãn is forever satya.  \nHowever, that same Bhagvãn appears sometimes as Matsya, Kurma, \nVarãh, Nrusinh, and other countless svarups.  How should this be \nunderstood?  Furthermore, is the method of kalyãn and the murti of \nBhagvãn in each brahmãnd the same, or different?” \n \n4.5 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The murti of Bhagvãn is always the same.  \nEven then, by His own wish, Bhagvãn shows His murti wherever and \nin whatever murti is required.  He also reveals His powers to \nwhatever extent is appropriate in various places.  He always has two \narms, but by His wish, at times He appears with four arms, or eight \narms, or even countless arms.  He also appears in svarups like Matsya \nand Kurma.  In this way, He incarnates in whichever svarup is \nappropriate for the place.  However, He always resides in His dhãm in \none svarup. \n \nLOYÃ \n- 318 - \n4.6 \n“Furthermore, while remaining in one location, He pervades the \ncountless millions of brahmãnds through His antaryãmi svarup.  For \nexample, Vyãsji was one, but when he called out to Shukji, he did so \nby residing in all the sthãvar and jangam beings.  When Shukji \nreplied, he did so in the same way.  In this way, even great yogis like \nShukji are capable of pervading the entire world.  Such people have \nattained such extraordinary powers as rewards of worshipping \nBhagvãn.  But, Purushottam Bhagvãn, who is called Yogeshvar, is the \nmaster of all extraordinary powers.  So, while still remaining in one \nlocation, what is surprising about Him incarnating, by His own wish, \nwherever and however is appropriate?  What is so surprising about \nBhagvãn possessing such abilities?  People become astonished even \nwhen a magician displays simple illusions, and they cannot fully \ncomprehend the magic.  But, Bhagvãn possesses all extraordinary \npowers and is the greatest source of wonder.  So, how can the jeev \nknow Him? \n \n4.7 \n“The Shreemad Bhãgvat mentions, ‘This many have overcome \nBhagvãn’s mãyã’.  However, it also mentions, ‘No one has overcome \nthe force of Bhagvãn’s mãyã’.  Here, a person should realise that if \neven those like Brahmã were to doubt Bhagvãn’s extraordinary \npowers, then they cannot be said to have overcome the power of \nBhagvãn’s mãyã.  What is this doubt?  It is the thought, ‘Why does \nBhagvãn behave like that?’  On the other hand, a person who \nunderstands ‘Bhagvãn is extremely powerful; so whatever He does is \nappropriate’, is said to have overcome mãyã. \n \n4.8 \n“In reality, the method for kalyãn is the same; but because there are \nthree levels in the people who worship (uttam, madhyam, kanishth), \nand because there are countless levels in their shraddhã, there are \nmany differences in the path of kalyãn taken by people.  However, in \nreality, there is only one path of kalyãn.  After all, there is only one \nsvarup of Bhagvãn.  This Bhagvãn is extremely powerful and no one, \nincluding Akshar, is capable of becoming like Him.  This is an \nestablished principle.” \nLOYÃ \n- 319 - \n4.9 \nThen, Muktãnand Swãmi said to Shreeji Mahãrãj, “Today, Jhinã-Bhãi \nhas become very upset, and he said that since Mahãrãj did not come \nto my house, what is the point of me staying in that house?” \n \n4.10 Hearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “When a person loves by force and \nwith unhappiness, that love does not survive for very long.  Also, the \nbhakti and love of a person who is unhappy, is ultimately abolished.  \nTherefore, it is a great mistake to wear a sad face due to displeasure.” \n \n4.11 Jhinã-Bhãi then said, “When Bhagvãn and His sant come to a person’s \nhouse, his face should glow with delight; but when they do not come, \nhis face should definitely reflect disappointment and he should feel \nsorrow in his heart.” \n \n4.12 Hearing this remark, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A person should be \npleased when Bhagvãn and His sãdhus come, but he should never \ngrieve.  If his nature is to grieve, then ultimately, something \nmisfortunate is bound to occur.  Therefore, while following his own \ndharma, a person should happily follow Bhagvãn’s ãgnã, but he \nshould never become upset in order to get his own way.  If Bhagvãn \nissues an ãgnã to go somewhere and the person becomes disturbed \nout of grief, then the darshan and prasãd previously given by \nBhagvãn, the countless types of talks relating to gnãn, and all other \nactions by which he had felt happiness, are all lost.  Furthermore, due \nto the disturbance, only tamo-gun spreads throughout the mind.  \nTherefore, he goes where he is asked to go in a state of pure misery.  \nThen, as a result of the distress, he cannot carry out the ãgnã \ncompletely.  Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvãn should remain ever \njoyful and should worship Bhagvãn with a cheerful mind.  Moreover, \nhowever unpleasant his circumstances may be, he should not allow \neven the slightest trace of depression to enter his heart.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 4 || 112 || \n \nLOYÃ \n- 320 - \nLoyã – 5 \nControlling The Indriyas And The Antah-Karans \n \n5.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Kãrtik vad Amãs [5th \nDecember, 1820], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in \nSurã Khãchar’s darbãr in Loyã.  He was wearing a white survãl and a \nwhite dagli made of chhint.  He had also tied a white pãgh around His \nhead.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \n \n5.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked all the paramhans, “By revealing which \nthoughts can a person be considered to be honest, and by not \nrevealing which thoughts can a person be considered to be \ndeceitful?” \n \n5.3 \nAs the paramhans were unable to answer, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, \n“Any weakness in following the panch-vartmãn, which cannot be \novercome by a thought process, should be revealed before a sant who \nhas no such weaknesses.  If a person has perceived avgun in a sant, \nthat should also be revealed.  Furthermore, any doubts in his \nnishchay in Bhagvãn should also be revealed.  Only then can he be \nconsidered to be honest.  If any of these internal thoughts have \narisen, and they are not revealed before a sant, then such a person \nshould be known to be deceitful.” \n \n5.4 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked another question:  “If a person is \ndeceitful, and also cunning, how can he be recognised?” \n \n5.5 \nAgain, the paramhans were unable to answer. \n \n5.6 \nSo, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “His deceitfulness can be recognised by \nkeeping his company; and while staying with him, by observing him \nwhile he eats, drinks, sits, stands, walks, and talks.  Also, when \nseparated from him, if another person is asked to secretly observe \nhim, then his deceitfulness would be recognised.” \nLOYÃ \n- 321 - \n5.7 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then posed another question:  “Suppose there is a \nperson who follows the vartmãn and keeps nishchay in Bhagvãn out \nof pretence.  He is intelligent and arrogant, and he shows his nishchay \nand his observance of the vartmãn to be more superior than the \ngenuine vartmãn and nishchay of others.  So, how can a person’s false \nnishchay and observance of vartmãn be recognised?” \n \n5.8 \nOnce again, the paramhans were unable to answer the question. \n \n5.9 \nSo, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “His pretence can be recognised when his \nreputation is insulted.  Otherwise, it cannot be recognised.” \n \n5.10 Again, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Which thought causes a person to \ndeflect from his nishchay in Bhagvãn and observance of vartmãn?  \nWhich type of thought would not cause a person to deflect from \nthem?  Also, if there is a time span, for what duration must these \nthoughts remain in order to deflect a person from his dharma and his \nnishchay in Bhagvãn?” \n \n5.11 Again, the paramhans were unable to answer. \n \n5.12 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “If a person attempts to eradicate an \nimproper thought related to dharma, but the thought still remains; \nor, if such a thought does not arise for fifteen days or for a month, but \narises someday suddenly – then such a thought would cause him to \nfall from dharma.  The same applies to a person’s nishchay in \nBhagvãn.  However, any thought which is eradicated by applying a \nthought process once it arises, and which does not arise again, would \nnot cause a person to fall from his dharma or his nishchay.” \n \n5.13 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Whose foundation in satsang becomes \nsolid, and whose does not?” \n \n5.14 Once again, the paramhans could not answer. \nLOYÃ \n- 322 - \n5.15 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Dattãtrey perceived the gun of the five \nmahã-bhuts, the moon, various animals, a prostitute, a virgin, his own \nbody, and many others.  Similarly, if a person has the nature of \nperceiving the gun of a sãdhu, his foundation in satsang will become \nsolid.  If a person does not have such a nature then even though he \nremains in satsang, his foundation is not firm.” \n \n5.16 Again, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Can the indriyas and the antah-karans \nin a person be completely controlled by the company of the sant, by \nreading the shãstras, and by applying his own thought process?  Or \ncan they be controlled if only one of these three is present?  If you say \nthat all three must be present, then what methods should be learnt \nfrom a sant, what methods should be learnt from the shãstras, and \nhow would a person apply his own thought process?  Please explain \nthis.” \n \n5.17 Again, the paramhans were unable to answer. \n \n5.18 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “From the shãstras, a person should \nrealise the greatness of Bhagvãn and His sant.  From the sant, a \nperson should learn methods for controlling the indriyas.  For \nexample, a person’s vision should be kept fixed on the nose in this \nway, and he should not listen to worldly talks.  These and other \nmethods should be learnt from a sant.  By his own thought process, a \nperson should look positively upon the methods taught by the sant, \nas being for his own kalyãn.  Then, he should behave accordingly.  In \nthis way, the indriyas and antah-karans can be overcome by these \nthree methods.” \n \n5.19 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj posed another question, “Are the antah-karans \ncontrolled by controlling the indriyas, or are the indriyas controlled \nby controlling the antah-karans?” \n \n5.20 Since the paramhans could not answer the question, Shreeji Mahãrãj \nreplied, “If a person controls the physical indriyas by physical tap, \nand then even after the physical indriyas have been controlled, if he \nLOYÃ \n- 323 - \nstill firmly follows the niyams of the panch-vartmãn, then the antah-\nkarans can be controlled by controlling the physical indriyas.  So, the \nphysical indriyas cannot be controlled by controlling the antah-\nkarans alone.  However, the antah-karans can be controlled by \ncontrolling the physical indriyas.  How is that?  Well, if a person \ncontrols the physical indriyas and does not let them indulge in the \nvishays, then the antah-karans within would become frustrated and \nwould think, ‘This type of enjoyment is not going to be possible in this \nlife’.’’ \n \n5.21 After this, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “By what method are the physical \nindriyas controlled and by what method are the antah-karans \ncontrolled?” \n \n5.22 Again, since the paramhans could not answer, Shreeji Mahãrãj \nreplied, “The physical indriyas can be controlled by following the \nniyams specified for a tyãgi in the Dharma-Shãstras; by controlling \nthe diet; by following vrat like tapta-kruchhra and chãndrãyan; by \ndeliberately tolerating cold, heat, hunger, and thirst; by engaging in \nthe kathã, talks, and kirtans of Bhagvãn; by engaging in bhajan and \nsmaran; by controlling the posture; and by many other spiritual \nactivities.  The antah-karans of a person can be controlled by thinking \nof Bhagvãn’s greatness, by performing dhyãn upon Bhagvãn, and by \nrealising himself to be the ãtmã.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 5 || 113 || \n \n \nLoyã – 6 \nPurifying The Company A Person Keeps \nThe Difficulties Of Becoming An Ekãntik Bhakta \n \n6.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Mãgshar sud 1 [6th \nDecember, 1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in Surã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Loyã.  He was wearing a white khes and a white dagli made \nLOYÃ \n- 324 - \nof chhint.  He had also tied a white feto around His head and had tied \na bokãni with another feto.  The chhoglu of the white feto was \nhanging from His head.  In addition to this, He had covered Himself \nwith a chãdar.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n6.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked the paramhans, “After joining satsang, \nwhat do you consider to be the most difficult achievement?” \n \n6.3 \nThe paramhans could not answer the question, so Shreeji Mahãrãj \nreplied, “For a person to become ekãntik is extremely difficult.  What \nis this state of being ekãntik?  Well, it is to do bhakti of Bhagvãn along \nwith dharma, gnãn, and vairãgya.  That is the state of being ekãntik.” \n \n6.4 \nAgain, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Which one activity related to dharma \nis such that if it is practiced, all aspects of dharma remain?  Moreover, \nout of bhajan, smaran, singing or listening to kirtans, listening to \ntalks, and other spiritual activities, which one activity, if it is kept \neven when all others are abandoned in difficult times, helps maintain \nall of the others?” \n \n6.5 \nShreeji Mahãrãj answered His own question:  “Of the activities \nrelated to dharma, if a person maintains the vow of nishkãm, all other \nactivities will develop.  Of the spiritual activities, if a person keeps \nnishchay in Bhagvãn, then all of the others will develop.” \n \n6.6 \nAgain, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Which type of thinking, if maintained \nconstantly, is beneficial; and if altered, is destructive?  Also, which \ntype of thinking is beneficial if repeatedly altered, and destructive if \nnot altered?” \n \n6.7 \nAgain, Shreeji Mahãrãj answered His own question:  “Thoughts \nregarding a person’s nishchay in Bhagvãn should never be altered.  It \nis beneficial if they are repeatedly reinforced by listening to the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn.  Conversely, repeatedly altering them would \nbe destructive.  However, if a person has firmly decided in his own \nLOYÃ \n- 325 - \nmind, ‘I want to do this’, then that type of thinking should be \nrepeatedly altered on the advice of a sãdhu.  If the sãdhu suggests, \n‘You should not sit here and should not do this’, then a person should \nnot sit there and should not do that.  If his own decision is altered, it \nwould be beneficial; if it is not altered and he does as he pleases, then \nthat would be destructive.” \n \n6.8 \nAgain, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “By sitting with and listening to which \ntype of satsangi or paramhans would make him subject to developing \nfaults, despite the fact that he follows dharma?” \n \n6.9 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a person has nishchay in Bhagvãn and \nfollows dharma, but also believes himself to be the body and has \npride as well as desires for worldly activities, then if Bhagvãn and His \nsant criticise these, he will definitely perceive avgun in Bhagvãn and \nHis sant.  Then, he will talk about the perceived avgun of Bhagvãn \nand His sant to others, and cause them to become like a vimukh.  A \nbhakta should not associate with such a person in any way; doing so \nis harmful.” \n \n6.10 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Which type of sãdhu, even though he \nfollows dharma and has nishchay in Bhagvãn, should a person not \naccompany to bathe, sleep near, or hear talks from?” \n \n6.11 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered His own question:  “A sãdhu who \ndiscouragingly says, ‘Can the vow of nishkãm and other qualities really \nbe attained in one life?  They are attained only by the grace of \nBhagvãn; otherwise kalyãn is attained after countless lives.  So, can \nkalyãn truly be attained in this very life?’  A person should shun the \ncompany of anyone who speaks such discouraging words.  \nConversely, someone else claims, ‘We are fulfilled in this very life.  The \nforce of kãm, krodh, mad, matsar, mãn, and other vicious natures is \nsmall.  By the grace of Bhagvãn and His sant, we will destroy them all’.  \nA person should, by all means, seek the company of a sãdhu who \nspeaks in this way and is eagerly engaged in methods to destroy the \nvicious natures.” \nLOYÃ \n- 326 - \n6.12 Again, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Which type of sãdhu, even if he speaks \nencouragingly, should be shunned?” \n \n6.13 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered His own question:  “If a sãdhu emphasises \nhis own efforts only and believes himself to be fulfilled by his own \nefforts, but does not acknowledge the strength of Bhagvãn and does \nnot feel, ‘By acting in this way, I want to please Bhagvãn’, then such a \nsãdhu should be shunned.” \n \n6.14 Again, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Which type of sãdhu should a person \nkeep the company of, and which type should a person not keep the \ncompany of?” \n \n6.15 Shreeji Mahãrãj then replied, “If we are staying with a sãdhu who \nfollows the vartmãn strictly and has firm nishchay in Bhagvãn, but \ninstead of lecturing us, he pampers us and lets us have our way, then \neven if he is considered great in public opinion, like Muktãnand \nSwãmi, his company should not be kept.  On the other hand, if a sãdhu \nrepeatedly lectures a person, and maintains constant awareness on \nany svabhãv he sees within him; and if he does not stop criticising \nthat svabhãv until it is overcome, and does not compliment him, then \neven if he is not considered great in public view, a person should still \nkeep his company.” \n \n6.16 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked another question:  “Suppose a sãdhu \npossesses all the glorious qualities like bhakti and gnãn.  However, \ndue to which one vicious flaw, should a person avoid his company?” \n  \n6.17 Again, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If he is very lazy, sleeps too much, \nand when told by others to bathe, perform dhyãn, or to follow other \nniyams, says, ‘I’ll do it later, what’s the hurry?  I’ll do them slowly’, then \neven though he may appear to be good, a person should avoid his \ncompany.” \n \n6.18 Shreeji Mahãrãj asked another question:  “A sãdhu may speak well; \nbut, due to which fault in his speech should his talks not be heard?” \nLOYÃ \n- 327 - \n6.19 Shreeji Mahãrãj then replied, “Out of arrogance, if he talks about the \nbhakti, gnãn, vairãgya, and dharma within himself to be superior; and \nshows the gun of bhakti, gnãn, vairãgya, and dharma in other sãdhus \nto be inferior, then a person should not listen to his talks.” \n \n6.20 Once again, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Which type of speech should be \nviewed as amrut even though it is harsh?” \n \n6.21 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The words of a sãdhu who in his speech \ncriticises his own parents, sister, brother, and varna, and ãshram \nwith harsh words, should be known to be good.  This is because a \nperson who hears those words realises the qualities of that sãdhu, \nand thinks: ‘In no way does this sãdhu have attachment to his bodily \nrelations’.  Therefore, those words should be enjoyed like amrut.” \n \n6.22 Shreeji Mahãrãj posed another question, “When should a person \nmaintain pride, and when should a person not maintain pride?” \n \n6.23 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered once again:  “A person should not maintain \npride before a devoted follower of Bhagvãn, even though he may be a \nsimple and humble haribhakta.  On the other hand, a person should \ncertainly maintain pride before a person who has fallen back from \nsatsang.  In fact, a person should not become suppressed by him; and \nin any question-answer exchange, his words should be answered \nwith harsh words.” \n \n6.24 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “When should a person have a desire \nfor the darshan of Bhagvãn and His sant?  When should he not have \nsuch a desire?” \n \n6.25 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Suppose I were to ask all the sãdhus, ‘Who \nwill go to Burãnpur and Kãshi?’  Then, when no one speaks, someone \nshould rise in the sabhã and say to me, ‘Mahãrãj, if you say so, I shall \ngo’.  So saying, he should follow my ãgnã and go there.  In those \nLOYÃ \n- 328 - \nsituations, to gain my happiness, a person should not keep any desire \nfor keeping the company of sant or my darshan. \n \n6.26 “Moreover, when a person – who a sãdhu or I have criticised, \nlectured, insulted, or expelled, and who is crying out of shock – is \napproached by an ekadmal vimukh who starts to talk about the avgun \nof the sãdhu or me, then before him, the person should reveal \ntremendous love towards the sãdhu and Bhagvãn.  He should say, ‘I \nam his servant, and even if he were to cut me to pieces, I still would \nnever perceive avgun in him.  He will grant me kalyãn’.  In that \nsituation, he should reveal great love.” \n \n6.27 Again, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “What should not be done, even if \nBhagvãn is pleased by it?  What should be done, even if Bhagvãn is \ndispleased by it?” \n \n6.28 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered His own questions:  “If I were to give an \norder which seems to be full of adharma, then a person should be \nhesitant in following it; he should take some time and not accept it \nimmediately.  For example, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn ordered Arjun, \n‘Cut off Ashvatthãmã’s head’.  But, Arjun did not follow that ãgnã.  \nLikewise, even if I am pleased by it, that type of instruction should \nnot be followed.  Also, an instruction by which the prescribed niyams \nof the panch-vartmãn are disobeyed should not be followed.  If by not \nobeying these two types of ãgnã, Bhagvãn is displeased, then a \nperson should definitely let Him be displeased; in those cases, a \nperson should not attempt to please Him.” \n \n6.29 Shreeji Mahãrãj asked again, “While performing dhyãn upon \nBhagvãn, countless different waves of vicious thoughts arises in the \nmind, just as large waves arise in the ocean.  When such thoughts do \narise, how can they be suppressed?” \n \nLOYÃ \n- 329 - \n6.30 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered His own question:  “When such vicious \nthoughts arise, a person should stop the dhyãn, and should clap and \nchant ‘Swãminarayan, Swãminarayan’ loudly, without shame.  He \nshould pray to Bhagvãn, ‘O lord!  You are a friend of the humble!  You \nare an ocean of mercy!’  Also, he should remember a great sãdhu of \nBhagvãn, like Muktãnand Swãmi, and pray to him too.  As a result of \nthis, all disturbing thoughts will be eradicated, and peace will prevail.  \nApart from this, there is no other method to eradicate such thoughts.” \n \n6.31 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj posed another question:  “Which quality \nshould be abandoned, even if it is believed to be a great quality in this \nsatsang and is being praised by all?  Which fault, even though it is a \nfault, is suitable to be absorbed?” \n \n6.32 Once again, Shreeji Mahãrãj supplied the answer Himself:  “A person \nmay be like Muktãnand Swãmi and may be following the vartmãn \nstrictly than all.  However, as a result of this, if another sãdhu feels \ninferior because he cannot behave on the same level, then that \nquality, even though it may be great, should be abandoned.  Instead, \nhe should behave on the same level as all the other sãdhus.  Even \nthough behaving on the same level as others is a drawback, it should \nbe done.” \n \n6.33 Again Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “In these sãdhus, which is the one flaw \nwhich, when abandoned, would cause all flaws to be abandoned?  \nWhich is the one quality which, if developed, would cause all qualities \nto be developed?” \n \n6.34 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “All flaws in a person reside in the flaw of \nperceiving himself with the body.  If that is abandoned, all flaws are \nabandoned.  Furthermore, if the sole quality of ãtmã-nishthã \n(realising himself as the ãtmã, and distinct from the body) is \ndeveloped, then all qualities will develop.” \n \nLOYÃ \n- 330 - \n6.35 Shreeji Mahãrãj again asked, “Which types of panch-vishays, when \nindulged in, enlighten the mind, and which types of vishays, when \nindulged in, cause ignorance to prevail in the mind?” \n \n6.36 Again, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “By indulging in vishays related to \nBhagvãn, the mind is enlightened; and by indulging in worldly \nvishays, ignorance prevails in the mind.” \n \n6.37 Next, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Which desh, which kãl, which sang, and \nwhich kriyã should a person not associate with, even if it is Bhagvãn’s \nãgnã?” \n \n6.38 Shreeji Mahãrãj again supplied the answer Himself:  “Even if it is \nBhagvãn’s ãgnã, a sãdhu should not stay in a place where he has \nfrequent contact with his bodily relations.  Also, if I seat him where \nwomen can also be seen while having darshan, and if I were to say, \n‘Do my darshan’, then he should not sit in that place.  Instead, he \nshould make an excuse and leave.  In addition, if unpleasant kãl is \nprevailing and riots are taking place, then even if it is Bhagvãn’s ãgnã \nto stay, a person should leave that place; but he should not stay there \nand suffer beatings.” \n \n6.39 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked another question:  “Which shãstras \nshould be heard and studied, and which shãstras should not be heard \nor studied?” \n \n6.40 Once again, Shreeji Mahãrãj answered Himself, “Shãstras which do \nnot promote Bhagvãn possessing a svarup and do not describe \nBhagvãn’s avatãrs, but instead discuss pure Vedãnt and propose a \nsingle, formless entity, should never be studied or heard; even if they \nhave been written by someone very intelligent.  On the other hand, \nsimple kirtans, like those composed by Ranchhod Bhakta, should be \nsung and heard if they describe Bhagvãn’s murti.  Such shãstras \nshould only be studied and heard.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 6 || 114 || \nLOYÃ \n- 331 - \nLoyã – 7 \nThe Indriyas, The Antah-Karans, And Experience \n \n7.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Mãgshar sud 3 [7th December, 1820], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in Surã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Loyã.  He was wearing a white pãgh, with the \nchhoglu hanging on one side.  He was wearing a white dagli made of \nchhint and a white, cotton-padded survãl.  He had also covered \nHimself with a white pachhedi.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n7.2 \nIn the sabhã, Nityãnand Swãmi brought the Vachanãmrut manuscript \nand presented it to Shreeji Mahãrãj.  Shreeji Mahãrãj examined the \nmanuscript and was extremely pleased by it.  He then said to the \nparamhans, “Today, please ask complex questions so that we may \nhave a discussion.” \n \n7.3 \nThen, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “The Shrutis state: \n \nrute gnãna-na muktihi \nThere is no kalyãn without gnãn. \n \ntameva viditvãti-mrutyumeti nãnyaha panthã vidyate-yanãya \nOnly by knowing Him does a person go beyond death; there is no other path \nfor attaining kalyãn. \n \n \n“These shloks state that the jeev attains kalyãn only when it realises \nthe true gnãn of Bhagvãn.  If kalyãn can only be attained by gnãn, \nwhy do the shãstras also prescribe other spiritual activities for \nattaining kalyãn?” \n \n7.4 \nHearing this question, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Gnãn means ‘to know’.” \n \n7.5 \nAt this point, Nityãnand Swãmi raised a doubt.  He said, “If gnãn \nmeans merely ‘to know’, then the whole world knows Bhagvãn \nthrough the shãstras.  However, not everyone attains kalyãn.” \nLOYÃ \n- 332 - \n7.6 \nHearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj raised a question, “Just as a person does \nnot attain kalyãn by knowing the previous avatãrs of Bhagvãn \nthrough the shãstras, do you think all those who actually had the \ndarshan of Rãm, Krishna, and other avatãrs of Bhagvãn with their \nown eyes attained kalyãn?” \n \n7.7 \nMuktãnand Swãmi replied, “Those who merely see the pratyaksha \nsvarup of Bhagvãn only attain kalyãn after several lives.” \n \n7.8 \nShreeji Mahãrãj added, “Those who know Bhagvãn through the \nshãstras also receive kalyãn after several lives.  This is because the \nBhagvãn that these people know through the shãstras is the same \nBhagvãn other people see with their eyes; and the Bhagvãn that other \npeople see with their eyes is the same Bhagvãn that people know \nthrough the shãstras.  Therefore, the resulting rewards of both are \nequal, and both attain kalyãn after several lives. \n \n7.9 \n“After all, is not hearing Bhagvãn with the ears, gnãn?  It is, but that \ncan be said to be merely hearing Bhagvãn.  Is not touching Bhagvãn \nwith the skin, also gnãn?  It is, but that can be said to be merely \ntouching Bhagvãn.  Is not seeing Bhagvãn with the eyes, gnãn?  It is, \nbut that can be said to be merely seeing Bhagvãn.  Is not smelling \nBhagvãn with the nose, gnãn?  It is, but that is merely smelling \nBhagvãn.  Does not describing Bhagvãn with the tongue also \nconstitute gnãn?  It does, but that is merely having described \nBhagvãn.  In this way, gnãn can be attained through the physical \nindriyas.  It can also be attained through the antah-karans, as well as \ndirectly from the experienced gnãn of the jeev, which is greater than \nboth the indriyas and the antah-karans.  Of these, which gnãn are you \nspeaking of? \n \n7.10 “In order to create the universe, Bhagvãn assumed the svarup of \nAniruddha; and within Aniruddha dwells the sthãvar and jangam \nworld, along with ãkãsh.  In the svarup of Sankarshan, Bhagvãn \nLOYÃ \n- 333 - \ndestroys the universe.  In the svarup of Pradyumna, He sustains the \nuniverse.  He also assumes various avatãrs, such as Matsya and \nKurma.  He assumes these svarup according to whichever task needs \nto be accomplished in whichever place.  Some of these tasks are \ninvisible to the indriyas and antah-karans, and can only be known by \nexperience.  For the successful completion of these tasks, Bhagvãn \nassumes a suitable svarup.  On the other hand, some of these tasks \nare visible to the indriyas and antah-karans.  For the successful \ncompletion of these tasks, again Bhagvãn assumes an appropriate \nsvarup.  Therefore, the gnãn of which of Bhagvãn’s svarup is \ninstrumental in attaining kalyãn?  Is that your question?” \n \n7.11 Nityãnand Swãmi confirmed, “We are saying that kalyãn is attained \nby the gnãn of Bhagvãn whose svarup can be realised by the indriyas, \nthe antah-karans, and experience.” \n \n7.12 Shreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “That Bhagvãn is Shree Krishna.  He \nhas said of himself: \n \nyasmãt-ksharama-teetohama-kshãradapi chottamaha \nI am greater than all this is perishable, and I am greater than the \nimperishable.  \n \nvishtabhyãham-idam krutsnam-ekãnshena sthito jagat \nI sustain the entire universe with a single fragment of myself. \n \nmattaha parataram nãnyat-kinchid-asti dhanamjaya \nmayi sarvam-idam protam sutre maniganã  iva \nO conqueror of wealth (Arjun).  There is nothing at all that is greater than me. \nAll this creation is strung upon me – like a series of gems on a thread. \n \npashya me pãrth rupãni shatasho-tha sahasra-shaha \nnãnã-vidhyãni divyãni nãnã-varna-kruteeni cha \nO Son of Prutha (Arjun)!  Behold my hundreds and thousands of divya svarups \nthat are of various types and of assorted colours and shapes. \n \nLOYÃ \n- 334 - \n7.13 “In these and many other shloks, He describes Himself as invisible to \nthe indriyas and the antah-karans.  Therefore, knowing Bhagvãn \nperfectly means knowing pratyaksha Bhagvãn through the indriyas, \nthe antah-karans, and experience.  Only then can a person be said to \npossess perfect gnãn.  However, if any one of these three types of \ngnãn is lacking, a person cannot be said to have realised ãtyantik \ngnãn, nor can he overcome the cycle of births and deaths.  In fact, \neven though someone may have attained the brahm-svarup state \nthrough his personal activities, if he does not realise pratyaksha \nBhagvãn in this way, he cannot be said to possess perfect gnãn.  That \nis why it is said in the Shreemad Bhãgvat:  \n \nnaishkarmyama-pyachuta-bhãva-varjitam na \nshobhate gnãn-malam niranjanam \nEven pure gnãn, in which all karmas have been rejected, is not elegant if it \ndoes not have bhakti towards Bhagvãn. \n \n7.14 “The Geetã also states:  \n \nkarmano haypi boddhavyam boddhavyam cha vikarmanaha \nakarmanash-cha boddhavyam gahana karmano gatihi \nThe nature of karma should be understood, the nature of prohibited karmas \nshould be understood, and the nature of non-karma should also be understood.  \nIndeed, the way of karma is very complex. \n \n \n“Even in the state of non-karma (gnãn), there is still something left to \nbe realised.  That is to say, even after a person has become brahm-\nrup, he still has to realise Parbrahm Purushottam.  Only a person who \nis brahm-rup has the right to offer bhakti to Purushottam. \n \n7.15 “Now, what constitutes bhakti?  It is when a person becomes brahm-\nrup and performs the bhakti of pratyaksha Bhagvãn with sandalwood \npaste, flowers, shravan, and manan – just as the niranna-muktas of \nShvet-Dvip, having become brahm-rup, perform pujã of Parbrahm \nNãrãyan by offering various types of offerings, such as sandalwood \npaste and flowers.  Therefore, Bhagvãn has mentioned in the Geetã: \nLOYÃ \n- 335 - \nbrahma-bhootaha prasannãtmã na shochati na kankshati \nsamaha sarveshu bhooteshu mad-bhaktim labhate param \nA person who has become brahm-rup remains joyful, grieves nothing, desires \nnothing, behaves equally with all beings, and attains my supreme bhakti. \n \n7.16 “Therefore, a person who does not offer bhakti to Parbrahm after \nbecoming brahm-rup, cannot be said to have attained ãtyantik kalyãn.  \n \nbhoomir-aponalo vãyuhu kham mano buddhir-eva cha \nahankãra iteeyam me bhinnã prakruti-rashtadhã \nThese are my eight forms of prakruti – pruthvi, jal, tej, vãyu, ãkãsh, man, \nbuddhi, and ahankãr. \n \n“This describes the all-pervaded jad prakruti. \n \n7.17 “Furthermore, \n \napareyam-itas-tvanyam prakrutim viddhi me parãm \njeeva-bhootam mahãbaho yayedam dharyate jagat \nBut O mighty-armed Arjun!  Also, know my other prakruti, the very element of \nlife (chaitanya), by which this world is upheld.  Such is the all-pervasive \nchaitanya prakruti. \n \n \n“This describes the all-pervasive chaitanya prakruti. \n \n7.18 “That pratyaksha Bhagvãn is such that He is the supporter of both the \neight forms of jad prakruti and also of the chaitanya prakruti that \npervades within.  For example, ãkãsh is the supporter of the other \nfour elements – pruthvi, jal, vãyu, and tej.  Whenever pruthvi \ncontracts, ãkãsh contracts along with it.  When the pruthvi expands, \nãkãsh also expands along with it.  Similarly, ãkãsh also contracts and \nexpands along with the contraction and expansion of jal, tej, and \nvãyu.  However, pruthvi and the other tattvas all contract and expand \nwithin ãkãsh.  In the same way, Bhagvãn expands and contracts along \nwith the expansion and contraction of the two prakrutis, while they \nthemselves contract and expand within Bhagvãn Himself.  That \nBhagvãn is the ãtmã of all.  This fact is stated in the Shrutis: \nLOYÃ \n- 336 - \nantah-pravishtaha shãstã janãnam sarvãtmã \nBhagvãn, who enters within all, is the controller and ãtmã of all beings \n \nyasyãksharam shareeram… \nesha sarva-bhootãntarãtmã-pahata-pãpmã divyo, deva eko nãrãyanaha \nHe, whose sharir is the imperishable, is the indwelling ãtmã of all beings, is \nwithout all evil, and is the one divya Bhagvãn Nãrãyan \n \nyasyãtmã shareeram ya ãtmãnam-antaro \nyamayati sa ta ãtmãntaryam-yamrutaha \nHe, whose sharir is the ãtmãs, and who governs all ãtmãs from within, is your \nãtmã, the antaryãmi, and immortal \n \nyasya pruthivi shareeram yaha \npruthiveem-antaro yamayati sa ta ãtmãntaryãm-yamrutaha \nHe, whose sharir is pruthvi and who governs it from within, is your ãtmã, the \nantaryãmi, and is immortal. \n \n7.19 “Furthermore, even food, the mind, knowledge, and bliss have been \ndescribed as brahm; various such types of brahm-vidyã have been \nmentioned.  What is the significance of this?  Well, those things have \nbeen called brahm because Bhagvãn is the cause of all and the \nsupporter of all.  However, they are all the sharir, and their shariri is \npratyaksha Shree Krishna Purushottam.  Both the jad and chaitanya \nprakrutis, along with their entities that have evolved in their \nexpanded and contracted states, dwell easily within Bhagvãn.  \nMoreover, Bhagvãn dwells within them all as their antaryãmi and as \ntheir cause.  It is that very Bhagvãn who is pratyaksha.  To know and \nsee Bhagvãn with such an understanding of greatness is called \nperfect gnãn.” \n \n7.20 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “If a person cannot experience the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn in this way, but does have a firm belief of it in \nhis antah-karans, then can that be said to be perfect gnãn, or not?” \n \n7.21 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “In a dark house, a person can faintly see the \ngrain-store and the pillars; but due to the darkness, they cannot be \nLOYÃ \n- 337 - \nsaid to have been seen totally.  In the same way, both the jad and \nchaitanya prakrutis reside within Purushottam Bhagvãn, and He \ndwells within them as well.  But, if a person experiences this only by \nassumption and does not actually see it, then he cannot be said to \npossess perfect gnãn.  Nevertheless, because he has such a firm \nnishchay, he surely must have experienced some sort of alokik \npowers of Bhagvãn in the past; if not, he will experience them in the \nfuture. \n \n7.22 “Despite having such a doubtless nishchay, if he does not experience \nthe alokik powers, he should think, ‘Bhagvãn possesses all those \npowers, but He does not reveal them to me because that is His wish’.  If \na person offers bhakti to Bhagvãn with such understanding and \nremains fulfilled, then he can also be said to possess perfect gnãn. \n \n7.23 “Therefore, a bhakta with gnãn is a person who thoroughly knows \nBhagvãn through the indriyas, the antah-karans, and experience.  \nSuch a bhakta has been praised in the Geetã as the best of all bhaktas: \n \n \nãrto jignãsur-arthãrthee gnãnee cha bharatar-shabha \nteshãm gnãnee nitya-yukta eka-bhaktir-vishishyate \nO supreme among the descendants of Bharat (Arjun).  Four types of people \nworship me: a person who is distressed, a person who seeks knowledge of the \nãtmã, a person who desires material objects, and a person who has gnãn.  Of \nthese, the one with gnãn is the best because he is always engaged in me and is \ndevoted to me alone. \n \n7.24 “A bhakta with gnãn, faithfully serves pratyaksha Bhagvãn – who \neternally has a svarup – realising Him as greater than Prakruti, \nPurush and Akshar, and as being the cause and supporter of all.  This \nunderstanding constitutes gnãn; and such gnãn leads to ãtyantik \nmoksh.  Those who do not understand this, merely claim ‘aham-\nbrahmãsmi’ – I am brahm – from the shãstras.  They proclaim, ‘I am \nthe svarup of brahm, and Ram and Krishna are merely avatãrs \noriginating from me’.  Such blasphemous and unorthodox vedãntis of \nLOYÃ \n- 338 - \ntoday are extremely evil and great sinners.  At death, they are sent to \nNarak, and they will never be released from there.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 7 || 115 || \n \n \nLoyã – 8 \nHyperactive Indriyas \n \n8.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Mãgshar sud 5 [10th \nDecember, 1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in Surã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Loyã.  He was wearing a white khes and had tied a white \nfeto around His head.  He was also wearing a white dagli made of \nchhint.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \n \n8.2 \nThen, Muktãnand Swãmi asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “On seeing some \ninappropriate svabhãv of a sãdhu, a person who is thoughtless may \nperceive avgun in the sãdhu.  But, why does a person who is wise \nperceive avgun in the sãdhu?” \n \n8.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a person is wise and has noticed an \ninappropriate svabhãv within himself, has a hatred towards it, and is \ncontinually acting to overcome that svabhãv, then when he sees that \nvery same svabhãv in another sãdhu, he develops a dislike towards \nthat sãdhu.  On the other hand, a fool does not overcome his own \nsvabhãvs, and when he sees that same svabhãv in another sãdhu, he \nperceives avgun in that sãdhu.  Such a person should be considered a \nfool.” \n \n8.4 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj gathered the junior paramhans, and He \nHimself asked and answered questions. \n \n8.5 \nFirst, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “The intensity and mildness of the force \nof kãm, krodh, lobh, and other enemies is due to the phases of \nLOYÃ \n- 339 - \nchildhood, youth, and old age.  In childhood the force is weak; in \nyouth, the force in intense; then in old age the force becomes weak \nagain.  Therefore, the intensity and mildness of the inner enemies can \nbe noticed; but can they be weakened by any thought process?” \n \n8.6 \nShreeji Mahãrãj Himself replied, “The force of the enemies can be \nweakened by a thought process, which is as follows:  The mildness of \nthose svabhãvs in childhood, their greater intensity in youth, the \nmildness once again in old age, is due to food.  Specifically, in \nchildhood, since the dietary intake is small, the force of kãm is mild.  \nSimilarly, in old age, a person dietary intake is small, so again the \nforce of kãm is mild.  But in youth, as the dietary intake increases, \nkãm also increases.  Therefore, in youth, if a person’s food intake is \ndecreased, and if he deliberately tolerates cold, heat, rain, and \nhunger, then by maintaining such a thought process, and by \nmaintaining profound association with a great sant, the force of kãm \nis weakened – even in the period of youth.” \n \n8.7 \nAgain, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “People become addicted to many \ndifferent types of substances, like bhãng, cannabis, opium, and \nalcohol.  Are these addictions due to a person’s kriyamãn or \nprãrabdha karmas?” \n \n8.8 \nReplying, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “These addictions are developed not \nby prãrabdha, but by habit.  Therefore, if a person maintains courage, \nkeeps shraddhã, and is determined to defeat the addiction, then it can \nbe overcome.  But, if he has no shraddhã and is cowardly, then that \naddiction cannot be overcome.” \n \n8.9 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Some children have a mature nature \nlike elder people, whereas some have an extremely fidgety nature.  Is \nthat nature due to company, or is it inherent within the jeev?” \n \n8.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “For the most part, a good or bad nature is \ndue to the company kept by a person; but in some cases, it is due to \npast karmas.” \nLOYÃ \n- 340 - \n8.11 Then, Kapileshvarãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, how can a person \nrecognise a svabhãv which has formed in a past life, and how can he \nrecognise a svabhãv which has formed in this life?” \n \n8.12 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A recently formed svabhãv is overcome by \nstaying in the company of a devout sãdhu and by making a little effort \nto eradicate it.  Just as grass growing on a wall dries up when there is \nno rain for five days, similarly, a recently formed svabhãv can be \novercome in a few days.  However, a svabhãv that has remained for a \nlong time is difficult to overcome, even after great effort is made to \neradicate it.  For example, if there are strong weeds or a bordi tree in \nthe soil, then even if they are set on fire and burnt by a farmer, they \nwill still grow.  However, if a person uses a hoe to uproot them from \ntheir roots, they can be removed.  Similarly, if a person remains in the \ncompany of a devout sãdhu and persists with great effort, even an \nestablished svabhãv can be overcome; but only with great effort.” \n \n8.13 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “For a person whose indriyas are \nhyperactive, what are the individual methods by which that \nhyperactivity can be overcome?” \n \n8.14 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “To overcome the hyperactivity of the eyes, a \nperson should fix his gaze on the tip of his and nose and not look \nelsewhere.  While studying, he should also engage in bhajan and \nsmaran.  While doing this, if he continues to keep his eyes open \nwithout blinking for half an hour or so – until his eyes begin to burn \nintensely and tears flow – and he does not hold a improper thought \neven if he happens to notice a woman or other objects, then even if \nhis eyes are hyperactive, they will become controlled. \n \n8.15 “The nose does not like the odours coming from someone’s body, \nmouth, or clothes.  At that time, a person should think, ‘My own body \nappears attractive superficially, but it is filled with blood, flesh, and \nbones; and in the abdomen there are faeces, urine, and the intestines’.  \nIf he thinks in this way, the hyperactivity of the nose is eradicated. \nLOYÃ \n- 341 - \n8.16 “The hyperactivity of the ears can be eradicated as follows:  When a \nperson hears some humorous talks or gossip, he develops a keen \ninterest to listen to them; whereas, while listening to the kathãs and \nkirtans related to Bhagvãn, he falls asleep.  In that situation, a person \nshould rise and suppress sleep and laziness.  He should also keep \nfaith in and maintain a keen interest in listening to the kathãs of \nBhagvãn.  The ears can be controlled in this way. \n \n8.17 “The sense of touch can be controlled by deliberately tolerating the \ncold, heat, and rain; by lying down anywhere; by keeping a blanket as \na pillow and using it for covering the body only when it is very cold.  \nTherefore, the skin becomes numb, and the hyperactivity of the sense \nof touch is eradicated. \n \n8.18 “To overcome the hyperactivity of the hands, a person should keep a \nmãlã in his hand whenever the hands are idle, and turn it while \nchanting the name of Bhagvãn in rhythm with the inhaling and \nexhaling of his breath.  However, he should not turn the mãlã \nhurriedly.  Some say, ‘A person can chant the name of Bhagvãn more \nquickly mentally’.  That principle is wrong, as the mind can only chant \nthe name of Bhagvãn as many times as the tongue can chant the \nname of Bhagvãn.  So, by applying this method, the hyperactivity of \nthe hands is eradicated. \n \n8.19 “If the legs are hyperactive, they can be controlled by controlling the \nsitting posture. \n \n8.20 “Hyperactive genitals can be controlled as follows:  When a person \ngets scabies or ringworm, and he scratches himself, the itching is not \nrelieved until bleeding occurs.  However, if he does not scratch the \naffected area, then the itching decreases by itself.  Therefore, even if \nan itching sensation arises on the genitals, it should not be scratched.  \nMoreover, in the case of it becoming frequently excited, if a person \ndecreases his diet, does upvãs, and physically weakens the body, then \nthe genitals can be controlled. \nLOYÃ \n- 342 - \n8.21 “To conquer the tongue, it should not be given items that it likes, and \nthe diet should be restricted.  In this way, the hyperactivity of the \ntongue is eradicated.   \n \n8.22 “Finally, the hyperactivity of a person’s speech can be eradicated by \nnot interrupting with wise remarks when people like Muktãnand \nSwãmi are speaking or narrating from the shãstras.  Moreover, if a \nperson does happen to interrupt, he should turn a mãlã twenty-five \ntimes.  By this method, the hyperactivity of speech can be \neradicated.” \n \n8.23 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Of all these indriyas, which one, if fully \ncontrolled, leads to control over all the other indriyas?” \n \n8.24 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered His own question, “If the tongue is fully \nsuppressed, then all the other indriyas can be suppressed.” \n \n8.25 Again, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “If kãm pervades a person’s heart, and \neven though his genitals are covered by his clothes, how can a person \nrealise that he has been pervaded by kãm?” \n \n8.26 Shreeji Mahãrãj Himself replied, “When kãm pervades a person, his \neyes, and all of his other indriyas become hyperactive.  In this way, a \nperson can realise that he has become overwhelmed by kãm.” \n \n8.27 Once again, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “A person who has a hyperactive \nnature should become calm, and a person who has a calm nature \nshould become active.  By which thought process can this be \nachieved?” \n \n8.28 Shreeji Mahãrãj Himself replied, “If a person who is hyperactive \nthinks, ‘I am the ãtmã, brahm, genderless, and stable like ãkãsh’, and \nhe attains the upsham state through such thoughts, then he becomes \ncalm.  If a person who is calm wishes to become more active, then he \nshould realise the greatness of Bhagvãn and His bhaktas.  When he \nrealises the greatness of Bhagvãn, he engages in the nine forms of \nLOYÃ \n- 343 - \nbhakti, and performs basic service of the bhaktas of Bhagvãn.  As a \nresult of this, his nature becomes more active.” \n \n8.29 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Is there anything in the eight shãstras, \nsuch as the Shreemad Bhãgvat, which should be ignored, or should \neverything be remembered?” \n \n8.30 Replying to His own question, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “In all of those \nshãstras there are countless charitras, and through all of those \ncharitras, the strengths of the bhaktas who have attained Bhagvãn \nare described.  Therefore, they are all suitable to be remembered.  \nHowever, among all these charitras, only those charitras that match a \nperson’s own strengths should be remembered.  The others may be \nignored with the following understanding: ‘These talks are true, but \nthey are for the benefit of other bhaktas; they are not for me’.’’ \n \n8.31 Once more, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “All of you youngsters are seated \nhere; and from amongst you, all the sãdhus praise some and do not \npraise others.  Now, all of you are of a similar age and all have the \nsame company.  In fact, you all have the same food, clothing, upãsanã, \nshãstras, and mantra, and all listen to the same talks.  So, what is the \nreason for the difference in levels amongst you?  Moreover, he who is \na sãdhu, follows dharma completely, is unbiased, and views all \nequally; therefore, he would describe everyone as they truly are.  So, \nplease answer the question.” \n \n8.32 Again, Shreeji Mahãrãj provided the answer, “Only he who has \nshraddhã is praised by a sãdhu; and that is also why he follows \ndharma more strictly.  Also, he has shraddhã in serving a sant, and in \nlistening to the talks of Bhagvãn.  He also has faith in the sant.  \nTherefore, he has progressed.  On the other hand, he who has not \nprogressed, despite staying in such company, should be known to \nlack shraddhã.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 8 || 116 || \n \nLOYÃ \n- 344 - \nLoyã – 9 \nDevelopment Of Dharma, Gnãn, Vairãgya, And Bhakti \n \n9.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Mãgshar sud 6 [11th December, 1820], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in Surã Khãchar’s darbãr in Loyã.  He was \nwearing a white dagli made of chhint, and a white survãl.  He had also \ntied a white feto around His head.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n9.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj requested, “May all the paramhans please \nengage in a question-answer discussion amongst themselves.” \n \n9.3 \nÃtmãnand Swãmi then asked Akhandãnand Swãmi, “What are the \nfactors that lead to the development of vairãgya, gnãn, bhakti, and \ndharma?” \n \n9.4 \nShreeji Mahãrãj answered, “Vairãgya is developed when a person \ncomes to understand the nature of Kãl.  What is this nature of Kãl?  \nWell, it is to know the process of nitya-pralay, nimit-pralay, prãkrut-\npralay, and ãtyantik-pralay, as well as the lifespan of all beings from \nBrahmã to the smallest blade of grass.  After knowing this, if a person \nunderstands the body, the brahmãnd, and all other objects to be \nsubject to the force of Kãl, then vairãgya would arise. \n \n9.5 \n“Gnãn arises if a person listens to the Upanishads, such as the \nBruhadãranya Upanishad, Chhãndogya Upanishad, and Kathvalli \nUpanishad, the Bhagvad Geetã, the Vãsudev Mahãtmya, the Vyãs \nSutras, and other shãstras from a sat-purush. \n \n9.6 \n“Dharma arises if a person listens to the Yãgnavalkya Smruti, Manu \nSmruti, Parãshar Smruti, Shankh-Likhit Smruti, and other Smrutis.  \nBy doing so, dharma will arise, and a person will develop belief in \nthose shãstras. \n \nLOYÃ \n- 345 - \n9.7 \n“Bhakti arises if a person understands the avatãrs of Bhagvãn.  How \nshould he understand them?  Well, when he hears about the murti of \nBhagvãn that are in each khand; and when he hears about the dhãms \nof Bhagvãn – Golok, Vaikunth, Brahmpur, Shvet-Dvip; and when he \nlistens with a sense of admiration to the talks of the leelãs of Bhagvãn \ndescribing the creation, sustenance, and destruction of the universe; \nand when he listens with keen interest to the narration of the leelãs \nof Rãm, Krishna, and the other avatãrs of Bhagvãn, then bhakti \ntowards Bhagvãn would develop. \n \n9.8 \n“Now, even though a person in his initial stages has an immature \nmind, if he listens to the ceremonial Smrutis, dharma would develop.  \nLater, after becoming firm in his observance of dharma, if he listens \nto shãstras that explain upãsanã, then all three (gnãn, bhakti, and \nvairãgya) would develop.  These are the factors which lead to the \ndevelopment of the four qualities.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 9 || 117 || \n \n \nLoyã – 10 \nRemaining Without Moh \n \n10.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the morning of Mãgshar sud 8 [13th \nDecember, 1820], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead in Surã Khãchar’s darbãr in Loyã.  He was wearing a white \ndagli made of chhint and white survãl.  He had also tied a white feto \naround His head.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n10.2 Then, Nityãnand Swãmi said, “In this world, there are some men who \nhave such love for women and other objects, that if they were to be \nseparated, they would not be able to live.  There are others who have \nlove for women and other objects, but it is not as intense.  So, if they \nLOYÃ \n- 346 - \nwere to be separated, they would survive.  In this way, there are two \ntypes of people.  Now, if the first type of person, who involves himself \nin worldly life with love, were to meet Bhagvãn, he would become \nattached to Bhagvãn in the same way; if he were to be separated from \nBhagvãn, he would not be able to survive.  Moreover, if the second \nperson, with less love for worldly life, were to meet Bhagvãn, he \nwould have less love for Bhagvãn as well.  Is the difference between \nthese two types of people due to karmas, or is it eternal?” \n \n10.3 Hearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Those differences are not \ninherently present in the jeev; instead, they arise as a result of \nkarmas.  How does this happen?  Well, when a jeev performs a karma, \nthe force of its vruttis can be of three levels:  mild, medium, and \nintense.  The force with which the vruttis attach themselves to the \nobject, determines the effect of the karma upon the jeev.  As a result, \nthree levels of love arise due to these karmas.” \n \n10.4 Again, Nityãnand Swãmi asked, “Do the three levels in the force of the \nvruttis occur as a result of the gun, or is there some other reason?” \n \n10.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The three types of differences are not due to \nthe gun; to be more precise, when only the indriyas indulge in an \nobject, then a mild force results.  When the indriyas indulge in an \nobject along with the mind, a medium force develops.  When all three \n– the indriyas, the mind, and the jeev – combine and indulge in an \nobject, the vruttis develop an intense force.  Even if that intense force \naffects only the eyes, the other indriyas would follow, and the force \nwould affect them as well.  In this way, whichever indriya is primarily \naffected by the intense force, the other indriyas follow.  Moreover, \nthat intense force affects all three types of people – rãjasi, sãttvik, and \ntãmasi.  In fact, such intense force is present in each of the indriyas; \ntherefore, love for objects arises.” \n \n10.6 Then, Nityãnand Swãmi asked, “Why does he not develop love for \nBhagvãn with such an intense force?” \nLOYÃ \n- 347 - \n10.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Good and bad behaviour is determined by the \nfactors of desh, kãl, kriyã, dhyãn, shãstras, dikshã, mantra, and sang.  \nSo, if a person attains pleasant factors, then he develops love for \nBhagvãn quickly.  But, if he encounters unpleasant factors, then he \nwould develop love for objects other than Bhagvãn.” \n \n10.8 Then, Chaitanyãnand Swãmi asked, “What should a person do in \ndifficult times?” \n \n10.9 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Whenever and wherever times are difficult, \na person should abandon that place for another location; he should \nnot stay where the factor of kãl is unpleasant.  In actual fact, kãl, in \nthe form of Satya-Yug, Tretã-Yug, Dvãpar-Yug, and Kali-Yug, exists \nboth externally and internally.  So, when Kali-Yug is prevalent within \na person’s heart, he should not visualise the murti of Bhagvãn within \nhis heart; instead, it should be seen externally, before his eyes.” \n \n10.10 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “How can a person distinguish \nwhether a mild, a medium, or an intense force prevails within \nsomeone’s heart?” \n \n \n \n10.11 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “When the force is mild, a person would \nhave the same feelings on seeing a young girl, a young woman, or an \nold woman.  This is because only the vruttis of the indriyas have \nbecome involved.  As a result, a mild force has developed.  When the \nmind unites with the indriyas and they see the three types of women, \nthen no improper thoughts arise towards the young girl or the old \nwoman; but indecent thoughts certainly do arise towards the young \nwoman, and a disturbance is experienced.  This should be known as a \nmedium level force.  When both the mind and the jeev combine with \nthe indriyas and look at the three types of women, then improper \nthoughts arise towards all three types of women, and a disturbance is \nexperienced.  In fact, a person would experience such improper \nLOYÃ \n- 348 - \nthoughts even on seeing his own mother or sister.  This should be \nknown as an intense force.” \n \n10.12 Then, Brahmãnand Swãmi asked, “Suppose a person notices the \ndistinction between the three types of women, and notices their \nbeauty and ugliness, yet he does not experience any improper \nthoughts.  Which type of force is that?” \n \n10.13 Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Having realised an object to be the cause of \nintense misery and having reflected upon that fact, a person assigns \nserious flaws to that object.  The reflection of those disadvantages in \nthe mind then leads to those flaws being acknowledged by the jeev.  \nThe witness (Bhagvãn), who is greater than the jeev, also confirms \nthose flaws, and so an extremely firm belief in those flaws is \ndeveloped.  Therefore, when the vruttis of the indriyas enter the \nobject, the mind and jeev also go along with the vruttis; but since the \njeev’s deep belief of the flaw in the object pierces the mind and \nindriyas, even though the object is seen and fully recognised, an \nintense hatred still arises for it.  For example, if a snake’s venom is \ndropped into a bowl of sweet milk, and a person sees the venom \nbeing added, then even though the milk appears exactly as before, an \nintense hatred for it prevails in his heart.  This is because he has \nrealised, ‘If I drink the milk, I will die’.  Similarly, such a person has \nrealised, ‘This beautiful woman is an obstacle on the path of kalyãn; \nand she is the cause of extreme misery in this lok and in the higher loks.  \nIn fact, I have attained the company of women countless times in past \nlives in various life-forms, and if I still do not worship Bhagvãn, I will \nattain the company of countless more females.  Therefore, this \nattainment is not rare.  However, the company of Bhagvãn and His sant \nis extremely rare, and this woman is a major obstacle in the attainment \nof that’.  A person who has realised this and has intensely realised the \nflaws in the object, will never be infatuated on seeing a woman, \nregardless of how beautiful she may be. \n \nLOYÃ \n- 349 - \n10.14 “Furthermore, there is another way to remain free of infatuation:  \nJanak the Videhi, who was a great king and a bhakta of Bhagvãn, \nstayed in his kingdom and, due to his firmness in gnãn, remained free \nof infatuation even while indulging in attractive vishays.  Similarly, a \nbhakta with gnãn like Janak, has the thought, ‘I am the ãtmã – pure, \nchaitanya, unchanging, blissful, and imperishable.  However, vishays \nlike women and other objects, are full of misery; they are worthless, \nperishable, and jad’.  With this thought, he believes only his own self, \nthe ãtmã, as being blissful.  Also, he believes, ‘The pleasure and charm \nwhich are apparent in the vishays are only experienced due to the \nãtmã.  But, when the ãtmã leaves the body, that which was once \npleasurable becomes miserable’.  He reflects upon his ãtmã in this \nway. \n \n10.15 “He also reflects upon Paramãtmã, who is greater than the ãtmã, as \nfollows:  ‘I have attained this gnãn of the pure ãtmã, which is greater \nthan mãyã, by the grace of the sant.  That sant is a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  \nMoreover, that Bhagvãn is the ãtmã of even brahm, who is ãtmã of all.  \nHe is the ãtmã of Akshar, and is also the ãtmã of the countless millions \nof muktas.  I am the brahm-rup dãs of that Parbrahm Purushottam \nNãrãyan’. \n \n10.16 “Also, he understands the greatness of Bhagvãn by realising: \n \ndyupataya eva ten a yayur-antam anantatayã \ntvamapi yad-antarãnda-nichayã nanu sãvaranãhã \nEven the masters of the higher loks cannot understand your greatness, \nbecause it is endless.  Neither can you yourself understand your own greatness.  \nIn your each and every hair, countless brahmãnds and their barriers (jad \nprakruti) fly simultaneously at immense speed – like specks of dust flying in \nthe air.  Even the Shrutis, ultimately perish in you, and fail to praise your glory. \n \n“Such shloks have greatly explained the greatness of Bhagvãn.   \n \n10.17 “When a person, who has gnãn of his own self and of Bhagvãn, attains \na vishay, his mind would not even be slightly affected by it, regardless \nLOYÃ \n- 350 - \nof how appealing it may be.  He indulges in the essential vishays \nwithout becoming dependent upon them.  Instead, he indulges in \nthem independently of his own accord.  Just as a spider spreads its \nown web and then it independently retracts it when necessary, in the \nsame way, a bhakta possessing gnãn engages the vruttis of his \nindriyas in the vishays and retracts them on his own accord.  Such a \nperson feels as if he is in the forest, even if he is amongst people; and \nthough he may be in the forest, he experiences more happiness there \nthan a person does from ruling a kingdom. \n \n10.18 “The bhakta may reside in a kingdom, thousands of people may be \nunder his command, and he may be wealthy; but he himself does not \nfeel, ‘I have become very great’.  Furthermore, if the kingdom is \ndestroyed and he begs for food from house to house with a clay bowl, \nhe does not feel, ‘Now I have become poor’.  This is because he \nremains absolutely carefree in his own bliss, and he knows the \ngreatness of his own self and that of Bhagvãn.  Therefore, he views \ngold, dirt, iron, and stones as equal; he also feels calmness in praise \nand insult.  Since his vision has become broad, and he knows all \nworldly objects to be worthless, no objects are capable of binding a \nperson with gnãn.  For example, when a man who was initially poor \nreceives a kingdom, his vision becomes broad.  At first, he may have \nbeen selling bundles of wood or doing various other insignificant \njobs, but he forgets them all and he begins to do important tasks \nrelated to his kingdom.  Similarly, to a person with gnãn, all objects \nbecome worthless; and due to that gnãn, his vision becomes broad.  A \nperson with such an understanding becomes happy. \n \n10.19 “Also, if a person has faith, and he believes, ‘Whatever such a great \nsant and Bhagvãn say is the truth; there is no doubt in it’, and with this \nbelief he does as Bhagvãn and His sant instruct him to do, then that \nperson remains happy.  These are the two types of people who are \nhappy; apart from them, everyone is unhappy.  This is also described \nin the following shlok:  \nLOYÃ \n- 351 - \nyash-cha mudhatamo loke yash-cha buddheha param gataha \ntãvubho sukham-edhete klishya-tyantarito janaha \nIn this world, there are two types of people who experience the bliss of \nBhagvãn:  those who are utterly ignorant and have blind faith in Bhagvãn, and \nthose who are perfectly enlightened and have realised Bhagvãn.  Those who \nare in between, are troubled. \n \n10.20 “Also, in the Bhagvad Geetã, it is said: \n \nvishayã vinivar-tante nirãhãrasya dehinaha \nrasa-varjam rasopyasya param drushtva nivartate \nThe sense objects recede for a person who refrains from indulging in them.  \nHowever, the longing for them does not subside.  The longing subsides only \nwhen his vision reaches Bhagvãn. \n \n“This means that all objects, except Bhagvãn, become worthless to a \nperson whose vision becomes alokik in this way.  Moreover, the \nmeaning of these two shloks is the same.” \n \n10.21 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi said, “Mahãrãj, now please ask the question \nyou were going to ask.” \n \n10.22 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Is there only misery in mãyã, or is there \nalso some happiness in it?  That is the question.” \n \n10.23 Muktãnand Swãmi replied, “Mãyã causes only misery.” \n \n10.24 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Of the three gun – sattva-gun, rajo-gun, \nand tamo-gun – which arise from Mãyã, sattva-gun is said to give \nhappiness.  Furthermore, in the Shreemad Bhãgvat it is said: \n \nsattvam yad-brahma-darshanam \nSattva-gun leads to the vision of Bhagvãn. \n \n“It is also said that the products of sattva-gun are gnãn, vairãgya, \nwisdom, tranquillity, and discipline.  How is mãyã in this form a \ncause of misery?  Furthermore, it is stated in the eleventh skandh: \nLOYÃ \n- 352 - \nvidyavidye mama tanu viddhyud-dhava shareerinam; \nbandha-mokshakari ãdye mãyayã me vinir-mite \nO Uddhav!  Realise my two forms – both of which have been created from my \nmãyã:  the ancient vidya and avidya, which free and bind people respectively. \n \n“So, how is mãyã in the form of knowledge, which leads to moksh, a \ncause of misery?” \n \n10.25 Hearing the question, Muktãnand Swãmi and all the other paramhans \nsaid, “Mahãrãj, we are unable to answer, so please have mercy, and \ngive the answer yourself.” \n \n10.26 Hearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “To a sinful person, the svarup of \nYam-Rãj appears frightful and terrible, with large teeth and a large, \nfrightening mouth; he appears black like soot, huge like a mountain, \nand horrific like death.  In this way, his svarup appears dreadful.  \nHowever, to a good person, the svarup of Yam-Rãj appears very \npleasant, like Vishnu.  Similarly, to those who are vimukhs, mãyã \ncauses attachment and intense misery, while to a bhakta of Bhagvãn \nthat same mãyã is the cause of intense happiness.  Also, the entities \nthat have evolved out of Mãyã – the antah-karans, the indriyas, and \ntheir presiding devs – all support the bhakti of Bhagvãn.  Therefore, \nfor a bhakta of Bhagvãn, mãyã is not a cause of misery; it is a source \nof great happiness.” \n \n10.27 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “If mãyã is a cause of happiness, why \nis it that when a bhakta of Bhagvãn visualises the murti of Bhagvãn \nand engages in worship, mãyã, in the form of the antah-karans, \ncauses misery by generating many disturbing thoughts?” \n \n10.28 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Mãyã, in the form of the antah-karans, does \nnot cause misery to a person who thoroughly understands the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn and has an absolutely firm refuge of Bhagvãn; \nbut it does cause misery to a person who does not have this refuge.  \nFor example, a kusangi would attempt to dislodge only a weak \nLOYÃ \n- 353 - \nsatsangi; but no one would dare to dislodge a firm satsangi.  In fact, \nno one would be able to speak unkindly of satsang in his presence.  \nSimilarly, mãyã, in the form of the antah-karans, would never \nentertain a desire to intimidate a person who has a firm refuge in \nBhagvãn.  Instead, it would help his bhakti to flourish.  However, \nmãyã does deflect a person who has a slight deficiency in his refuge \nin Bhagvãn, and does cause him misery.  However, when that person \ndevelops a complete refuge in Bhagvãn, mãyã is not able to disturb \nhim or cause him pain.  Therefore, the answer is that if a person has \ncomplete nishchay in Bhagvãn, mãyã is not capable of causing him \nmisery.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 10 || 118 || \n \n \nLoyã – 11 \n Beliefs Of A Sat And An Asat Person \n \n11.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the morning of Mãgshar vad 8 [27th \nDecember, 1820], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in \nSurã Khãchar’s darbãr in Loyã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \n \n11.2 Then, Shuk Muni asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “What understanding does \nan asat-purush adopt from the Shreemad Bhãgvat, the Bhagvad \nGeetã, and other sacred shãstras?” \n \n \n \n11.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The answer is as follows:  An asat-purush \nperson believes that all the sthãvar and jangam male and female \nsvarups in this world have been created through Mãyã and the \nPurush, Virãt, and svarup of Bhagvãn.  This implies that all these \nsvarups are manifestations of Bhagvãn Himself.  For this reason, a \nperson aspiring for kalyãn should initially conquer his mind; and \nLOYÃ \n- 354 - \nthen, if his mind is attracted towards a higher or lower svarup of \neither a male or female, he should perform dhyãn upon that very \nsvarup in order to attain instantaneous samãdhi.  If the mind \nperceives any flaws in that svarup, then he should believe that svarup \nto be brahm by thinking, ‘The whole world is brahm’.  Thinking in this \nway, he should disprove the perception of those flaws.  In this way, to \naccept only the words regarding experiences from the shãstras is the \nunderstanding of an asat-purush.  Such a misunderstanding reflects \nthe wicked nature of his mind, and at the end of his life, he is sent to \nthe deep regions of Narak and the cycle of births and deaths.” \n \n11.4 Then, \nShuk \nMuni \nrequested, \n“Now, \nplease \nexplain \nwhat \nunderstanding a sat-purush person adopts from the sacred shãstras.” \n \n11.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “The answer to this question is given in \nthe sacred shãstras themselves.  Specifically, those desiring kalyãn \nshould not perform dhyãn upon – with the exception of Purushottam \nNãrãyan – any devs, such as Shiv and Brahmã.  Instead, among all \nhumans and devs, they should perform dhyãn only upon murtis, such \nas Rãm and Krishna, which are avatãrs of Purushottam Nãrãyan.  \nFurthermore, the wise bhaktas consider all the places where \nBhagvãn’s murti of Rãm and Krishna reside to be Vaikunth, Golok, \nShvet-Dvip, and Brahmpur.  They consider the pãrshads that dwell in \nthose loks to be the pãrshads of Rãm and Krishna, such as Hanumãn \nand Uddhav. \n \n11.6 “They also regard the divya murtis of Bhagvãn in those loks, which \nare radiant with the light of countless millions of suns, moons, and \nflames of fire, to be murtis of avatars such as Rãm and Krishna in their \ndhãms.  Therefore, a person who adopts such an understanding from \nthe sacred shãstras, and performs dhyãn on the human svarup of \nBhagvãn with a sense of divinity, never equates the svarups of \nBhagvãn’s avatãrs and other svarups.  In reality, all murtis of \nBhagvãn’s avatãrs have only two arms.  However, for the sole reason \nLOYÃ \n- 355 - \nof dismissing any similarity that a person lacking wisdom may \nperceive between Bhagvãn’s svarup and other svarups, they are often \ndescribed as having four arms or eight arms. \n \n11.7 “Moreover, a person should only perform dhyãn on the murti of \nBhagvãn that he has attained, not on the murtis of the previous \navatãrs.  Therefore, like a woman who keeps the vow of fidelity, a \nperson should remain totally faithful to the murti of Bhagvãn that he \nhas attained.  Pãrvati has also said,  \n \nkoti janma-laga ragad hamãri; varu Shambhu, ke rahu kumãri \nFor a million lives I have done so; I’ll marry Shambhu, or remain unwed.  \n \n“Such a vow of fidelity has also been mentioned in order to dismiss \nthe similarity that a person lacking wisdom perceives between the \nsvarup of Bhagvãn and other beings.  This is because if someone \nstrays from the murti of Bhagvãn which he has attained, and instead \nperforms dhyãn on the previous avatãrs of that very Bhagvãn, then \nhe may later even abandon Bhagvãn and perform dhyãn upon other \ndevs of other human svarups.  That is why the vow of fidelity has been \nmentioned, not because there is any difference between the murtis of \nBhagvãn themselves.  This is the understanding of a sat-purush.  \nTherefore, a person should only hear the sacred shãstras from a sat-\npurush person, but never from an asat-purush.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 11 || 119 || \n \n \nLoyã – 12 \nSavikalp And Nirvikalp Nishchay \n \n12.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Mãgshar vad 9 [28th \nDecember, 1820], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in \nSurã Khãchar’s darbãr in Loyã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes, and was also wearing a red, woollen dagli.  A sabhã of \nparamhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \nLOYÃ \n- 356 - \n12.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj raised a question:  “Nishchay in Bhagvãn is of \ntwo types: savikalp nishchay and nirvikalp nishchay.  In each type of \nnishchay there are three sub-categories:  uttam, madhyam, and \nkanishth.  Please describe the distinguishing characteristics of each of \nthese six sub-categories.” \n \n12.3 The paramhans were unable to answer, so Shreeji  Mahãrãj said, “The \ncharacteristics of a person with the kanishth savikalp nishchay are as \nfollows:  As long as Bhagvãn exhibits kãm, krodh, lobh, mãn, and svãd, \nto the same extent as other humans, the person’s nishchay in \nBhagvãn remains.  However, if Bhagvãn were to display these \nsvabhãvs more so than others, his nishchay would be shattered. \n \n12.4 “The nishchay of someone with the madhyam savikalp nishchay \nremains firm even if Bhagvãn exhibits kãm and krodh to a double \ndegree than that of humans. \n \n12.5 “Finally, a person with the uttam savikalp nishchay would never \ndoubt any action of Bhagvãn, even if Bhagvãn were to behave crudely \nlike a person of a low varna and ãshram; or exhibit anger or violence; \nor indulge in drinking alcohol, meat-eating, or adultery.  This is \nbecause he understands Bhagvãn to be the all-doer, the supreme \nlord, and the experience of everything.  Such a person realises that \nwhatever actions take place in the world are the result of Bhagvãn, \nwho is anvay within all beings as their controller.  If He were to \nindulge in some shameful deed, it would not affect Him at all since He \nHimself is the all-doer.  In this way, a person who has realised \nBhagvãn as the lord of all, is known as a bhakta of Bhagvãn with the \nuttam savikalp nishchay. \n \n12.6 “As for a bhakta with the kanishth nirvikalp nishchay, no matter what \ngood or bad deeds he witnesses being performed by Bhagvãn, he \nunderstands that in all actions Bhagvãn performs, He is still a non-\ndoer, since He is brahm.  That brahm is like ãkãsh; everything resides \nin ãkãsh and all actions take place within it.  The bhakta realises such \nqualities of brahm of Bhagvãn.  For example, during the narration of \nLOYÃ \n- 357 - \nthe rãs-leelã, Parikshit Rãjã asked Shukji, ‘Bhagvãn assumes an avatãr \nto uphold dharma.  Then, why did He associate with the gopis?’  Shukji \nreplied, ‘Shree Krishna is radiant like fire; whatever actions He \nperforms, good or bad, are burnt to ashes’.  In this way, a person who \nunderstands Bhagvãn as brahm, and unaffected by the actions He \nperforms, is said to have the kanishth nirvikalp nishchay. \n \n12.7 “A person who becomes like the niranna-muktas of Shvet-Dvip – who \nare free from the shad-urmi (six physical and emotional feelings) – \nand worships Vãsudev, is said to possess a madhyam nirvikalp \nnishchay. \n \n12.8 “Finally, a person possessing the uttam nirvikalp nishchay realises \nthat countless millions of brahmãnds, each encircled by the eight \nbarriers (jad prakruti), appear like mere atoms before Akshar.  Such \nis the greatness of Akshar, the dhãm of Purushottam Nãrãyan.  A \nperson who worships Purushottam realising himself to be akshar-\nrup, can be said to possess the uttam nirvikalp nishchay.”   \n \n12.9 Then, Chaitanyãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, how have these \ndistinctions in nishchay arisen?” \n \n12.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “When a mumukshu initially approaches a \nguru, several factors cause distinctions in his nishchay:  the \npleasantness and unpleasantness of desh, kãl, sang, dikshã, kriyã, \nmantra, and shãstras, with regards to the guru; as well as the \nintensity of his own shraddhã.  Therefore, a person should always \nassociate with pleasant desh, kãl, kriyã, and sang.  Moreover, a person \nshould acquire wisdom from a speaker who is calm and faultless.” \n \n12.11 Chaitanyãnand Swãmi asked further, “If under such circumstances a \nperson develops the kanishth nishchay, can it later develop into the \nuttam nishchay?” \n \nLOYÃ \n- 358 - \n12.12 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If the listener possesses extreme shraddhã; \nand if he encounters pleasant desh, kãl, kriyã, and sang; and if he \nencounters a guru with the uttam gnãn, then the highest nishchay will \ndevelop.  Otherwise, such nishchay would develop after many lives.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 12 || 120 || \n \n \nLoyã – 13 \nNot Being Overcome By Unpleasant Circumstances \n \n13.1 In the early morning of Mãgshar vad 10 [30th December, 1820], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead in Surã Khãchar’s darbãr in Loyã.  He was wearing a red, \nwoollen dagli and a white khes.  He had tied a white feto around His \nhead, and had tied a bokãni with another white feto.  In addition to \nthis, He had covered Himself with a white chofãl.  A sabhã of \nparamhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n13.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then told the senior paramhans to ask questions \namongst themselves.  So, Gopãlãnand Swãmi asked Brahmãnand \nSwãmi, “What type of person is overcome by unpleasant desh, kãl, \nkriyã, and sang; and what type of person is not overcome?  After all, it \nis said that even Brahmã was infatuated upon seeing Sarasvati, as \nwas Shivji when he saw Mohini.  So, please answer carefully, because \neven such great devs have been overcome by unpleasant \ncircumstances.” \n \n13.3 Brahmãnand Swãmi attempted to answer, but could not give an \nadequate reply. \n \n13.4 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “A person who has withdrawn his \nnãdis and prãns, and by way of his nirvikalp state remains at the holy \nLOYÃ \n- 359 - \nfeet of Bhagvãn, would not be overcome by unpleasant desh, kãl, \nkriyã, and sang, even if he was an insignificant being.  In fact, if \nBrahmã and other devs behave in this way; they would also not be \novercome.  However, if he has not developed such a state, and \ninstead, behaves as if he is the body, then average beings, as well as \ngreat devs, would be overcome.  If this were not so, then the meaning \nof the following shlok would not be true: \n \ntat-shrushta-shrushta-shrushteshu konvakhandita-dheehee pumãn \nrushim nãrayanam-rute yoshin-mãyyeha mãyayã \nOf the progeny of Brahmã (Marichi), and their progeny (Kashyap), and their \nprogeny (humans and devs) – whose mind in this world, besides that of \nNãrãyan Rushi, can be distinguished as being unaffected by the mãyã and \nattractive charm of women? \n \n13.5 “Therefore, Bhagvãn alone is not overcome by those influences.  \nWhile all others, no matter how great they may be, if they are not \nengrossed in the holy feet of Bhagvãn, would be overcome; those \nwho do remain engrossed are not overcome.  This is a universal \nprinciple that I have firmly established within myself. \n \n13.6 “Moreover, it is mentioned in the Shreemad Bhãgvat: \n \netad-eeshanam-eehasya prakrutisthopi tad-gunahee \nna yujyate sadãtmasthair-yathã buddhis-tad-ãshrayã \nJust as a person’s buddhi (knowledge of Bhagvãn) is not affected by the \ncharacteristics of the body (such as birth, death, age, illness), similarly, \nBhagvãn, who pervades Prakruti, is forever unaffected by their influences and \nthe influences of ãtmãs.  This is the ability of Bhagvãn. \n \n13.7 “Krishna Bhagvãn has also said: \n \ndaivee hyeshã guna-mayee mama mãyã duratyayã \nmãm-eva ye prapadyante mãyãm-etam taranti te \nMy mãyã, which I have created and is composed of the three gun, is indeed \ndifficult to rise above.  However, those who take refuge in me alone can rise \nabove that mãyã. \nLOYÃ \n- 360 - \n13.8 “Therefore, only Bhagvãn remains unaffected by mãyã; and a person \nwho has realised Bhagvãn through a nirvikalp state is also not \novercome by mãyã.  On the other hand, someone who has realised \nBhagvãn through a savikalp state would still be overcome, no matter \nhow great he may be.” \n \n13.9 Then, Nityãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, as long as a mukta is \nassociated with the three gun (sattva-gun, rajo-gun, tamo-gun), he is \naffected by desh, kãl, kriyã, and sang.  However, it is accepted that \nBhagvãn is not influenced by desh, kãl, kriyã, and sang – even while \nHe remains with the gun.  However, when all the muktas are free \nfrom the association of the gun, and have become nirgun, they dwell \nin Akshardhãm along with Bhagvãn – who dwells there in the same \nway; and all the muktas are nirgun, and composed of chaitanya.  Also, \nas explained by ‘mama sãdharmya-mãgatãha’, they have attained \nqualities similar to those of Bhagvãn.  Then, how should we \nunderstand the distinction between the muktas and Bhagvãn?” \n \n13.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “Look at the moon and the stars.  Is there \nnot a difference between the two?  They are not similar in terms of \nbrightness, and there is a vast difference between the intensity of \ntheir rays.  All the herbs are nourished by the moon, but not by the \nstars.  Also, it is the moon that dispels the darkness of the night, not \nthe stars.  Bhagvãn and the muktas differ in the same way. \n \n13.11 “Also, a king and his servant are both the same, as they both are \nhumans; yet the authority, power, beauty, and charm of the king are \nfar more superior.  His servant, regardless of how great he may be, \ncannot achieve what the king can achieve.  In the same way, \nPurushottam Nãrãyan is the all-doer, the cause of all, the controller of \nall; He is extremely attractive, extremely radiant, and extremely \npowerful; also, He possesses kartum, akartum, and anyathã-kartum  \npowers.  If He wishes, He can conceal all the muktas of Akshardhãm \nby His own divine light and prevail alone.  Also, if He wishes, He can \nLOYÃ \n- 361 - \naccept the bhakti of the muktas and reside with them.  He can conceal \neven Akshar, in the svarup of Akshardhãm, in which He dwells, and \npreside alone.  If He so chooses, He is capable of supporting the \ncountless muktas by His own power, without even needing \nAkshardhãm.  For example, Pruthu Bhagvãn told Pruthvi, ‘I can kill \nyou with the arrow from my bow and still be able to support the whole \nworld by my powers’.  Likewise, through His powers, Bhagvãn reigns \nas the supreme lord.  A person who equates Bhagvãn with Akshar and \nthe other muktas should be regarded as evil-minded and as a great \nsinner.  A person should avoid even looking at him.  In fact, merely \nlooking at such a person is as sinful as committing the five great sins. \n \n13.12 “Of course, by considering their association with Bhagvãn, it is \nacceptable to grant greatness upon anyone.  Brahmã, Shiv, Nãrad, the \nSanakãdik, and Uddhav can all be called Bhagvãn because of their \nassociation with Bhagvãn.  At present, even a sãdhu like Muktãnand \nSwãmi can be considered to be like Bhagvãn because of his \nassociation with Bhagvãn.  However, without Bhagvãn, even Akshar \ncannot be called Bhagvãn – let alone anyone else. \n \n13.13 “This Vedic shlok reflects the same truth: \n \naparimitã dhurvãs-tanubhruto yadi sarvagatãs-tarhi \nna shãsyateti niyamo dhruva netarathã \nO loyal Bhagvãn!  If the embodied jeevs, which are innumerable and eternal, \nare believed to be all-pervasive, then they would not be governable.  Not \nbelieving them as all-pervasive would not cause any discrepancies. \n \n“If this were not so, then why would we – despite regarding ourselves \nto be brahm-rup, and distinct from the body, and possessing gnãn \nand vairãgya – try to please Bhagvãn by staying up day and night, \nclapping, singing kirtans, and chanting His holy name tirelessly?  Why \nwould we engage in kathãs and talks day and night, and encourage \nothers to do so as well?  Why would we make so much effort if we \ncould become like Bhagvãn?  Therefore, only Bhagvãn is like \nLOYÃ \n- 362 - \nBhagvãn; no one can become like Him.  The Vedic shlok ‘ekam-\nevãdviteeyam brahm’ also explains that Bhagvãn alone is like \nBhagvãn.  This is the principle of all the shãstras.” \n \n13.14 In this way, Shreeji Mahãrãj addressed the bhaktas for their benefit, \nwhen in reality He Himself is Purushottam Nãrãyan. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 13 || 121 || \n \n \nLoyã – 14 \nPersonal Preference Of Shreeji Mahãrãj \n \n14.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Mãgshar vad 11 [31st December, 1820], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in Surã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Loyã.  He was wearing a white khes, and had tied \na white feto around His head.  He had covered Himself with a white \nchãdar.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \n \n14.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said to the paramhans, “All the ãchãryas of the \npast have had differing beliefs.  Of them, Shankar Swãmi seems to \nhave leaned predominately towards the Advait principle.  Rãmanuj’s \nprinciple is that jeevs, Mãyã, and Purushottam are eternal; \nPurushottam is the controller of the jeevs and Mãyã; He is the \nultimate cause of all; He forever dwells in His Akshardhãm in a divya \nsvarup; all avatãrs originate from Him; and it is this Purushottam \nNãrãyan that should be worshiped.  This seems to be the \nunderstanding of Rãmanuj.  Vallabh-Ãchãrya seems to have intense \nfaith only in bhakti.  All these ãchãryas have occasionally referred to \nother principles in their own shãstras, but ultimately, in one way or \nanother, they have leaned towards their own personal preference.  \nTheir views can be accurately understood from the statements in \ntheir shãstras. \nLOYÃ \n- 363 - \n14.3 “In the same way, having listened to my talks, what have all of you \nrealised my personal preference to be?  Just as a thread passes \nthrough the eye of a needle, or a thread runs through each and every \nbead of a mãlã, which principle is consistently interwoven in all of \nmy talks?  Please state your beliefs.” \n \n14.4 All the senior paramhans spoke according to their understanding. \n \n14.5 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Here, allow me to reveal my own \nprinciples and preferences. \n \n14.6 “First of all, I like the fact that although Rushabh-Dev Bhagvãn had \nattained oneness with Vãsudev, and despite being Bhagvãn Himself, \nwhen siddhi appeared before Him, He did not accept them because \nHe wished to set an example for all tyãgis.  Also, the Shreemad \nBhãgvat states:  ‘Even an accomplished yogi should never trust his \nmind – even though he may appear to have conquered it’.   \n \n14.7 “There are also these shloks: \n \nna kuryat-karhichit-sakhyam manasi hyanavasthite \nyadvistram-bhãchirãch-cheernam chaskanda tapa aishvaram \nNever befriend the mind because it is very unstable; it has even destroyed the \ntap of the devs that were accumulated after extensive activities over a great \nperiod of time.  \n \nnityam dadãti kãmasya-chhidram tam-anu yerayaha \nyoginaha kruta-maitrasya patyur-jãyeva punshchalee \nThe minds of those yogis who have befriended their minds continuously allow \nkãm to enter.  Other enemies, such as krodh, lobh, and moh, follow the kãm \ninto the mind.  In this way, the mind brings about the downfall of the yogis, \njust as an unfaithful wife brings about the downfall of her trusting husband. \n \n \n“In this way, I like a tyãgi who does not trust his mind. \n \nLOYÃ \n- 364 - \n14.8 “Also, in my mind I do not like other loks as much as I like Shvet-Dvip \nand Badrikãshram.  In fact, I feel that it would be very good to go \nthere to perform tap without any food.  I would prefer not to indulge \nin the various types of pleasures of the other loks. \n \n14.9 “Furthermore, I realise that the many avatãrs are all ultimately of \nBhagvãn; yet, among these avatãrs, I like Rushabh-Dev greatly.  I also \nlike Kapil-Dev and Dattãtrey equally, but to a lesser extent than \nRushabh-Dev.  But, more than these three, I have a million-fold more \nlove for the avatãr of Shree Krishna.  I feel, ‘This avatãr is greater and \nmore powerful than all the others.  Also, in him, a person cannot make \nthe distinction of the avatãr and the source of the avatãr’.  On the \nother hand, I do not have a great liking for the other avatãrs of \nBhagvãn, such as Matsya and Kurma. \n \n14.10 “In addition to this, my understanding is as follows:  There is a great \nmass of divine light, which cannot be measured from above, below, or \nin any of the four directions; it is endless.  Amidst this mass of light \nlies a large sinhãsan, upon which presides the divya murti of Shree \nNãrãyan Purushottam Bhagvãn.  Countless millions of muktas are \nseated around that sinhãsan, enjoying the darshan of Bhagvãn.  I \nconstantly see Him accompanied by the muktas.  Moreover, that \nBhagvãn is extremely luminous.  At times, when I cannot see Bhagvãn \nwith the sabhã of muktas due to this luminosity, I feel deeply hurt.  \nDespite being able to constantly see this mass of divine light, I am not \nfascinated by it; I experience profound bliss only from the darshan of \nBhagvãn’s murti.  This is my upãsanã. \n \n14.11 “Moreover, I like the bhakti that the gopis had towards Bhagvãn.  For \nthis reason, I continuously observe people, and having seen the love a \nlustful woman has for a man, or a lustful man has for a woman, I feel, \n‘It would be good to have such love for Bhagvãn’.  Also, whenever I see \nsomeone having great love for their son, or their money, I again feel, \n‘It would be good to have such love for Bhagvãn’.  That is why \nwhenever I hear someone singing, I would either send someone to \nLOYÃ \n- 365 - \nthat person, or I would personally go there, and I would feel, ‘What he \nis doing, is very good’. \n \n14.12 “Also, I only get along with a person who has no svabhãvs, such as \nkãm, krodh, lobh, mãn, irshyã, kapat, svãd, sneh, dambh; a person who \nfollows dharma as prescribed in the Dharma-Shãstras; and a person \nwho has bhakti towards Bhagvãn.  I enjoy the company of only such a \nperson.  If a person is not like that, then I do not get along with him, \neven if he is staying close to me.  In fact, I feel a dislike towards them. \n \n14.13 “Initially, I had a strong dislike for anyone with kãm.  However, now I \nhave a strong dislike for those who have krodh, mãn, or irshyã.  The \nreason is that a person with kãm passes his days in satsang by being \nhumble – like a grahastha bhakta; but as for those who have krodh, \nmãn, or irshyã, they can be seen to definitely regress in satsang.  For \nthis reason, I am deeply saddened by these types of people. \n \n14.14 “What is mãn like?  Well, a person with mãn remains arrogant even \nbefore those who are superior to him; he cannot become humble and \nserve them. \n \n14.15 “Now, allow me to summarise my preferences in brief.  I do not agree \nwith Shankar Swãmi’s belief of Advait principle.  Rãmãnuj Swãmi \ndescribes Purushottam Bhagvãn as greater than the perishable and \nthe imperishable; I worship that Purushottam Bhagvãn.  My bhakti \ntowards that Purushottam Bhagvãn is like that of the gopis, and the \nqualities of vairãgya and ãtmã-nishthã within me are like Shukji’s and \nJadbharat’s.  These are my principles and preferences.  Intelligent \nbhaktas can realise this if they analyse my talks as well as the \nshãstras of our sampradãy which have been accepted by me as \ntrustworthy.” \n \n14.16 Therefore, Shreeji Mahãrãj spoke for the sake of His bhaktas, while \nHe Himself is Purushottam Nãrãyan. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 14 || 122 || \nLOYÃ \n- 366 - \nLoyã – 15 \nÃtmã-Darshan \n \n15.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Mãgshar vad 13 [2nd January, \n1821], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in Surã Khãchar’s darbãr in Loyã.  \nHe was wearing a warm, red dagli and a white khes.  He had tied a \nwhite feto around His head, and had tied a bokãni with another white \nfeto.  In addition to this, He had covered Himself with a chofãl and a \npachhedi.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \n \n15.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said out of compassion, “The jeev pervades the \nentire body from head to toe through its three powers of adhyãtma, \nadhibhut, and adhidev.  Through the indriyas, and their presiding \ndevs, it experiences the vishays, but it cannot experience anything by \nbeing distinct from the presiding devs and the indriyas.” \n \n15.3 Then, Nityãnand Swãmi raised a doubt:  “Mahãrãj, it is said that the \njeev pervades the whole body in general, but resides specifically \nwithin the heart.  So, how should a person understand the fact that \nawareness is not present everywhere equally?” \n \n15.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “The sun pervades each and every object \nequally by its rays, but its light is seen according to the object it \nshines upon.  For example, pure sunlight is not experienced as \nintensely on stone or sand or in dirty water as it is on a floor made of \nglass or in clean water.  Therefore, just as a person experiences a \ngreater and lesser intensity in the sun’s light, in the same way, even \nthough the jeev resides equally in the indriyas, the antah-karans, and \nthe organs of the indriyas, a person experiences its power more \nintensely in the indriyas because of their purity.  For example, does a \nperson experience as much sensation in his nose and ears as he does \nin his eyes?  Certainly not.  Furthermore, the four antah-karans are \neven purer than the indriyas, and so the jeev’s power can be \nLOYÃ \n- 367 - \nexperienced there even more intensely.  In comparison, it is \nexperienced to a lesser degree in the indriyas.  Nevertheless, the jeev \ndoes pervade the entire body equally.” \n \n15.5 Then, Brahmãnand Swãmi asked, “Many see the jeev to be like a star, \nor like the flame of an oil lamp, or like the flash from a firecracker.  \nHow should a person understand these differences in experiences?” \n \n15.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “Just as a person who has mastered akshi-\nvidyã can see the jeev and the murti of Bhagvãn within with his eyes, \na person who has realised the ãtmã through the indriyas sees the \nãtmã in a similar way.  For example, if there was a glass-statue \nshaped in the svarup of a human – with all of its limbs, hair, and \nvessels made of glass – and if it were filled with light, then the light \nwould be seen only according to the size and shape of the tubes \nwithin; it would not be seen everywhere.  In the very same way, \npeople describe the nature of the jeev according to however they \nhave seen it.  However, because they have not attained nirãvaran \ndrashti, they do not see the ãtmã as it is.  However, when a person \nwho has not attained nirãvaran drashti and is one with his ãtmã, he \nno longer perceives the divisions of the different organs of the \nindriyas; instead, he realises the ãtmã as it truly is. \n \n15.7 “Just as a person who has attained the viewpoint of ãkãsh does not \nperceive the other four bhuts, similarly, a person with nirãvaran \ndrashti does not perceive differences in the jeev’s light arising from \nits indriyas, their organs and presiding devs, and the antah-karans; \ninstead, he realises the jeev precisely as it is.  On the other hand, a \nperson who perceives distinctions does not realise the jeev as it is.  \nFor example, from a group of people, one person saw the tail of a \ncow, one person saw its mouth, one person saw its hoof, one person \nsaw its belly, and one person saw its udder.  Whichever part of the \ncow was seen, belonged to the cow, yet no one saw the cow \ncompletely.  However, because at least one part was seen, it can be \nLOYÃ \n- 368 - \nsaid that the cow was actually seen.  In the same way, a person can be \nsaid to have had the darshan of the ãtmã to the extent to which he \nhas seen the light of the ãtmã through his indriyas or antah-karans.  \nHowever, this cannot be said to be perfect darshan of the ãtmã.  \nTherefore, I have explained the general and the specific experiences \nof the jeev in this way.”  \n \n15.8 At that point, Nityãnand Swãmi questioned, “Mahãrãj, you have \ndescribed the jeev as being nirãkãr.  Therefore, when Bhagvãn dwells \nwithin the jeev, does He reside without a svarup, or does He possess a \nsvarup?” \n \n15.9 Shreeji Mahãrãj clarified, “Bhagvãn dwells as the refuge of the \nindriyas, the antah-karans, their presiding devs, and the jeev.  For \nexample, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn made Uddhavji explain to the gopis, \n‘I am near to you by being the refuge of your indriyas, antah-karans, \ntheir presiding devs, and the jeev.  Just as the very same five mahã-\nbhuts which reside in the brahmãnds are also within everyone’s body, \nsimilarly, I reside in Mathurã like the mahã-bhuts reside predominantly \nin the brahmãnds; but just like those mahã-bhuts reside subtly in the \nbodies of the jeevs, I also reside within all of you.  The fact that I cannot \nbe seen is to keep the vrutti of your mind confined within me; that is \nwhy I cannot be seen.  Nevertheless, I reside within you, and I possess a \ndefinite murti’.” \n \n15.10 Hearing this, Nityãnand Swãmi questioned further, “Mahãrãj, does \nBhagvãn, who resides as the refuge of the indriyas, antah-karans, \ntheir presiding devs, and the jeev, reside in the svarup of Purush, \nAkshar, or as Purushottam Himself?” \n \n15.11 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The light of the jeev, Purush, Akshar, and \nPurushottam is very similar in terms of luminosity.  So much so, that \nno one is capable of distinguishing between their light.  However, \nthey are absolutely distinct from each other, but no one is capable of \nLOYÃ \n- 369 - \nseeing these distinctions.  Only a person who receives a divine body \ncomposed of divine light by the grace of Bhagvãn realises, ‘This is my \nown self, this is Purush, this is Akshar, and this is Purushottam – who is \ndistinct from all’.  In this way, a person can see them separately, and \ntheir light distinctly.  However, no one else is capable of \ndistinguishing between them.  Therefore, Bhagvãn may reside in \nwhichever svarup He chooses, but it is He Himself who resides within \nthe jeev – no one else.” \n \n15.12 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, “There are three sets of shãstras \nwhich are eternal and which describe only the svarup of Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn.  They are Yog, Sãnkhya, and Vedãnt (the \nUpanishads).  I shall now explain the principles of each, so please \nlisten. \n \n15.13 “Those belonging to the Sãnkhya philosophy propose the existence of \ntwenty-four tattvas and believe that Bhagvãn is greater than them; \nthat is, Bhagvãn is the twenty-fifth tattva.  However, they do not \naccept jeev and ishvar as being distinct from the twenty-four tattvas.  \nTheir reasoning is that the tattvas cannot be sustained without the \njeev; so the jeev is imagined only as a form of the tattvas because of \nits close co-existence with them.  As a result, they do not consider the \njeev to be distinct.  Also, just as they regard the jeev as a form of the \ntattvas, they regard the ishvars as a form of the twenty-four tattvas.  \nIn this way, they imagine both jeev and ishvar among the twenty-four \ntattvas, and therefore count them together with the twenty-four \ntattvas; they do not consider them as being distinct from the tattvas.  \nThis, along with believing Bhagvãn to be the twenty-fifth tattva, is the \nphilosophy of Sãnkhya. \n \n15.14 “Despite this, a person should not conclude that there is no jeev at all, \nbecause the proposers of Sãnkhya have prescribed the six spiritual \nactivities (shat-sampatti – sham, dam, uparati,  titikshã, samãdhãn, \nand shraddhã) as well as shravan, manan, and nididhyãs, for the jeev.  \nLOYÃ \n- 370 - \nBy behaving in this way, the jeev attains a thought that eventually \nleads to the realisation of its distinction from the tattvas.  Then, a \nperson engages in the worship of Bhagvãn, realising himself to be \nbrahm-rup.  This is the Sãnkhya philosophy.  It is also mentioned in \nthe Moksh-Dharma, where Nãradji explains to Shukdevji: \n \ntyaja dharmam-adharma cha ubhe satyanrute tyaja \nubhe satyanrute tyaktvã yena tyajasi tat-tyaja \n \n“The meaning of this shlok is that when a mumukshu prepares to \nthink about his ãtmã, he should abandon all thoughts of dharma and \nadharma, satya and asatya, which disturb him.  In fact, he should also \nabandon the thought by which he abandons these other thoughts.  In \nthis way, he should behave as brahm-rup.  However, the shlok does \nnot suggest that a person should physically abandon the niyams in \nthe form of dharma.  This is the correct interpretation of the shlok. \n \n15.15 “Next, proposers of the Yog philosophy promote the twenty-four \ntattvas distinctly from the jeev and ishvar, whom they regard as the \ntwenty-fifth tattva, and Bhagvãn as the twenty-sixth.  With the power \nof discrimination they distinguish the twenty-fifth tattva (jeev) from \nthe other tattvas, and after firmly resolving that to be their form, they \ngather the vruttis of the twenty-four tattvas and forcefully attach \nthem to the twenty-sixth tattva (Bhagvãn); they do not allow them to \nbe drawn towards the vishays.  They believe, ‘If my vruttis abandon \nBhagvãn and wander elsewhere, I will have to pass through the cycle of \nbirths and deaths’.  Therefore, they forcibly keep the vruttis of their \nindriyas and antah-karans on Bhagvãn. \n \n15.16 “In comparison, the proposers of Sãnkhya believe, ‘I have no indriyas \nor antah-karans, so where shall the vruttis go?’  Therefore, they \nconsider themselves to be brahm-rup and remain fearless.  Those \nbelonging to the Yog philosophy remain constantly fearful.  For \nexample, if a person had to carry a pot filled to the brim with oil up \nsome stairs without spilling any oil at all, and if two swordsmen with \nLOYÃ \n- 371 - \ndrawn swords were on both sides trying to frighten him, that person \nwould be extremely afraid.  Followers of Yog remain just as afraid of \nthe vishays and strive to keep their vrutti fixed on Bhagvãn.  This is \nthe philosophy of Yog. \n \n15.17 “Vedãnt (the Upanishads) explains only Bhagvãn, who is the ultimate \ncause of all, as being the truth; they claim all else to be false.  Just as \nwhen a person attains the viewpoint of ãkãsh, he does not perceive \nthe other tattvas, in the same way, a person who sees only brahm, \nperceives nothing else.  That is the philosophy of Vedãnt.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 15 || 123 || \n \n \nLoyã – 16 \nWorldly Desires Becoming Blunt And Uprooted \n \n16.1 In the Samvat year 1877, after the sandhyã ãrti on Mãgshar vad 14 \n[3rd January, 1821], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead in Surã Khãchar’s darbãr in Loyã.  He was wearing a white \nkhes and a warm, red dagli.  He has also tied a white feto around His \nhead, and had tied a bokãni with another white feto.  A sabhã of \nparamhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him.  \n \n16.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “May the paramhans please engage in a \nquestion-answer discussion.” \n \n16.3 Then, Mahãrãj Himself asked a question:  “What are the \ncharacteristics of a person whose worldly desires have not become \nblunt, whose worldly desires have become blunt, and whose worldly \ndesires have been completely uprooted?” \n \n16.4 Muktãnand Swãmi began to answer the question, but could not reply \nadequately. \nLOYÃ \n- 372 - \n16.5 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The vruttis of the indriyas of a person \nwhose worldly desires have not become blunt, cling to the vishays.  In \nfact, they cannot be dislodged even by a thought process.  In \ncomparison, the vruttis of a person whose worldly desires have \nbecome blunt do not enter the vishays immediately.  If the vruttis \nwere to enter the vishays, and he attempts to withdraw them, they \nwould withdraw instantly; they would not remain attached to the \nvishays.  However, a person whose worldly desires have become \ncompletely uprooted is unaware of the vishays during the jãgrat \nstate, just as he is during the sushupti state.  He would regard all \npleasant and unpleasant vishays as equal and would behave as a \nperson who is gunãtit.” \n \n16.6 Then, Gopãlãnand Swãmi asked, “A person’s worldly desires may \nhave become blunt, but what is the reason for them not being \nremoved from their roots?” \n \n16.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The answer is that if a person has \nperfectly absorbed the following four qualities, then his worldly \ndesires will become uprooted:  gnãn in the form of knowledge of that \nãtmã; vairãgya in the form of detachment from all things that have \nevolved out of Prakruti; dharma in the form of brahm-chãrya; and \nbhakti coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvãn’s greatness.  Any \ndeficiency in these four qualities leads to a deficiency in uprooting a \nperson’s worldly desires.” \n \n16.8 Having given the reply, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Now, allow me to ask a \nquestion.  Countless spiritual activities have been prescribed for a \nmumukshu to perform in order to attain Bhagvãn.  Out of all of them, \nby which one powerful activity can all flaws be eradicated and all gun \nbe acquired?” \n \n16.9 The paramhans could not answer the question. \n \nLOYÃ \n- 373 - \n16.10 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj revealed, “If a person has bhakti coupled with the \nknowledge of Bhagvãn’s countless powers as described by Kapil-Dev \nto Devhuti, then all of his flaws would be eradicated: \n \nmad-bhayãd-vãti vãto-yam suryas-tapati mad-bhayãt \nIt is by fear of me that Vãyu (wind) blows, Surya (sun) shines, Indra (clouds) \nrains, Agni (fire) burns, and Yam (death) devours the living \n \n“Moreover, even if a person does not possess gnãn, vairãgya, and \ndharma, he still attains them.  Therefore, this spiritual activity is the \nbest of all.” \n \n16.11 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked another question:  “A person with kapat, \nwho is also clever, cunningly conceals his kapat.  Please explain how \nsuch a person’s kapat can be recognised?” \n \n16.12 Brahmãnand Swãmi answered, “Such a person can be recognised by \nthe fact that he keeps the company of someone who is an enemy of \nsatsang and who speaks unkindly of Bhagvãn and His sant.  Such a \nperson cannot be known by any other means.” \n \n16.13 Shreeji Mahãrãj accepted the answer, but questioned further, “Yes, \nbut how can such a person be recognised if he does not keep the \ncompany of such people?” \n \n16.14 Brahmãnand Swãmi then added, “His kapat would be exposed in \ntimes of difficult circumstances.” \n \n16.15 Shreeji Mahãrãj confirmed, “That is the correct answer to the \nquestion.” \n \n16.16 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked another question:  “Which single avgun \ntransforms all of a person’s gun to avgun?” \n \n16.17 Shreepãt Devãnand Swãmi replied, “If someone criticises a bhakta of \nBhagvãn, then all of his gun become as good as avgun.” \nLOYÃ \n- 374 - \n16.18 Shreeji Mahãrãj clarified, “That is true, but I had another answer in \nmind.  A person may well be endowed with each and every gun, but if \nhe believes Bhagvãn to be nirãkãr, then that is a great flaw.  So much \nso, that because of this avgun, all of his gun become avgun.” \n \n16.19 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Why does a person perceive avgun in a \nsãdhu?” \n \n16.20 The paramhans attempted to answer the question, but were unable \nto give a precise answer. \n \n16.21 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj answered the question Himself:  “A person with \nmãn perceives avgun in a sãdhu.  This is because it is the very nature \nof someone who has mãn, that if someone praises him, even though \nthat person may have a hundred avgun, he would overlook them and \nwould instead greatly highlight a single gun.  Conversely, if a person \ndoes not praise him, then even though that person may have a \nhundred gun, he would overlook all of them and highlight an utterly \ninsignificant avgun.  Consequently, he would initially spite the person \nmentally, then verbally, and ultimately physically as well.  Therefore, \nmãn is a great flaw.  However, do not think that only the wise have \nmãn and the naïve do not.  In actual fact, the naïve have more mãn \nthan the wise.” \n \n16.22 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, how can mãn be \neradicated?” \n \n16.23 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “A person who thoroughly realises the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn does not have mãn.  Look at Uddhavji, and how \nwise he was!  He was skilled in the Niti-Shãstra, and had physical \ncharacteristics like that of a king.  However, as he had understood the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn, he put aside his mãn upon seeing the love of \nthe gopis for Bhagvãn, and prayed, ‘May I become a tree, a vine, a \nblade grass, or maybe a shrub – anything that has been touched by the \ndust from the feet of the gopis’. \nLOYÃ \n- 375 - \n16.24 “Tulsidãs has also said:  \n \ntulsee jyake mukhanse bhoole nikase rãm \ntãke pag kee paheniyãm mere tan kee chãm \n \n“This means that even if someone utters the name of Bhagvãn \nunintentionally, a person who realises Bhagvãn’s greatness would \nmake shoes from his own skin and offer them to that person.  If that \nis so, would he have any mãn before a bhakta of Bhagvãn who \nconstantly engages himself in worship and in chanting the name of \nBhagvãn, who bows down to Bhagvãn, and who realises the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn?  Certainly not.  Therefore, mãn is eradicated \nwhen a person realises the greatness of Bhagvãn, but without \nunderstanding the greatness of Bhagvãn, mãn simply cannot be \neradicated.  Therefore, whoever wishes to eradicate mãn should \nrealise the greatness of Bhagvãn and His sant.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 16 || 124 || \n \n \nLoyã – 17 \nNot Perceiving Avgun \n \n17.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Mãgshar vad Amãs [4th \nJanuary 1821], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead \nin Surã Khãchar’s darbãr in Loyã.  He had tied a white feto around His \nhead, and had tied a bokãni with another white feto.  He was also \nwearing a warm, red dagli with a white angarkhu inside.  He was also \nwearing a white khes.  In addition to this, He had covered Himself \nwith a chofãl, over which He had wrapped a yellow rajãi.  Shreeji \nMahãrãj was in a pleasant mood.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n17.2 Then, of His own will, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “See how powerful the \nforce of Bhagvãn’s mãyã is!  It can cause great wickedness.  Someone \nLOYÃ \n- 376 - \nwho previously seemed very good, can suddenly become extremely \nevil.” \n \n17.3 So saying, Shreeji Mahãrãj urged the paramhans, “Ask questions \ntoday, so that we can talk.” \n \n17.4 Then, Nityãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, the very same person who \nwas previously good and who prays to Bhagvãn, later begins to \ncriticise Him.  How can a good person remain good and never let his \nunderstanding become impaired, amidst even the most unpleasant \ndesh, kãl, kriyã, and sang?” \n \n17.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “If a person is indifferent to his body, has \nfirm ãtmã-nishthã, maintains vairãgya towards the panch-vishays, \nand has absolute nishchay in Bhagvãn coupled with the knowledge of \nHis greatness, then his mind will never become distorted – even \namidst the most unpleasant circumstances imaginable.  On the other \nhand, a person who believes himself to be the body, and does not \nhave an intense hatred for the panch-vishays, would spite a sãdhu if \nhe were to criticise the vishays, even though the sãdhu may be senior.  \nSuch a person would ultimately spite Bhagvãn as well.  Furthermore, \nif someone has firm nishchay in Bhagvãn, but lacks an extreme hatred \ntowards the vishays and is still attracted to them, then even if a \nperson like Muktãnand Swãmi were to criticise those objects, he \nwould go as far as to cut off the person’s head with a sword in order \nto harm that person.” \n \n17.6 “Nityãnand Swãmi then asked, “Someone may identify himself with \nthe body and may be attracted to the panch-vishays; yet he seems to \nsurvive in satsang.  How can this be explained?” \n \n17.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “He survives in satsang only as long as he is \nnot confronted by an unpleasant situation.  If a great sãdhu or \nBhagvãn were to criticise his mãn, svãd, lobh, kãm, krodh, or his belief \nthat he is the body, then he would surely develop a dislike for the \nsãdhu.  Then, he would certainly insult the sãdhu, and therefore fall \nLOYÃ \n- 377 - \nfrom satsang.  For example, whoever has drank sweetened milk that \nhas been poisoned by the venom of a snake, even though he may be \nliving at present, is sure to die – within half an hour, in the morning \nor in the evening, today or tomorrow; eventually, he will die.  In the \nsame way, he who identifies himself with the body, will definitely \ndislike the sãdhu, and will eventually fall from satsang – either after \none month or after two months; after one year or after two years or \neven after ten years; or maybe at the time of death or even after \ndeath – but he will certainly fall. \n \n17.8 “In comparison, there is a person who does not identify himself with \nthe body and believes, ‘I am the ãtmã, due to which this body \nfunctions; I am sachidãnand; I enlighten the indriyas and antah-\nkarans.  I am not a person who becomes happy by possessing wealth \nand women; nor am I a person who is saddened by not possessing \nthem’.  Such a person never dislikes a sãdhu, no matter how strongly \nthe sãdhu criticises the panch-vishays or the belief that he is the body.  \nFurthermore, he would never quarrel with the sãdhu over \ninsignificant issues, and nor would he hold a grudge against him.” \n \n17.9 Then, Nityãnand Swãmi asked again, “How can a person recognise \nsomeone who has a hatred for the panch-vishays?” \n \n17.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “A person with a hatred for the panch-\nvishays can be recognised by the following characteristics:  When he \nreceives luxurious food, he would eat it, but he would not enjoy it as \nmuch as he would enjoy eating simple food.  In fact, he would be \ntroubled by it.  Also, he would become upset wearing fine clothes; he \nwould not enjoy them as much as he would enjoy wearing tattered, \ncoarse clothes.  In fact, his mind becomes troubled by fine clothes.  If \nhe were to receive a luxurious bed, or if someone were to honour \nhim, or if he were to receive any sort of pleasant object, his mind \nwould become troubled by it; in no way would he be pleased by it.  \nOn seeing such a person, a person should realise, ‘He has a hatred for \nthe vishays’.” \nLOYÃ \n- 378 - \n17.11 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked another question, “Mahãrãj, how can \na hatred for the panch-vishays be developed?” \n \n17.12 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The most important method for \ndeveloping such a hatred for the panch-vishays, is the knowledge of \nBhagvãn’s greatness, followed by ãtmã-nishthã and vairãgya. \n \n17.13 “Now, what is this greatness of Bhagvãn?  Well, it is due to the fear of \nBhagvãn that Indra rains; that the sun, the moon, and flames of fire \nemit light; that the earth supports one and all; that the oceans do not \nexceed their boundaries; and that the herbs produce fruit in their \nappropriate seasons.  Also, it is Bhagvãn who is the creator, sustainer, \nand destroyer of the world, and whose powers include Kãl, Mãyã, \nPurush, and Akshar.  Then, what object in the world can attract \nsomeone who has understood the greatness of Bhagvãn in this way?  \nWell, not even kãm, krodh, lobh, mãn, irshyã, svãd, fine clothes, \nwealth, women, and none of the panch-vishays can bind him.  This is \nbecause he has assessed everything.  He knows, ‘Bhagvãn is like this, \nand these are the rewards of engaging in Bhagvãn’s worship and \nlistening to kathãs and talks.  Akshar is like this, and the bliss \nassociated with him is like this.  Furthermore, the pleasures of Golok, \nVaikunth, and Shvet-Dvip are like this, the pleasures of Prakruti and \nPurush are like this, the pleasures of Brahm-Lok are like this, the \npleasures of Svarg are like this, and the happiness of a kingdom is like \nthis’. \n \n17.14 “In this way, a person who has understood the happiness hidden \nwithin everything, realises the bliss of Bhagvãn to be the highest and \nthen attaches himself to Him.  Is there any object in the world that \ncan draw him away from the holy feet of Bhagvãn?  There is none.  \nFor example, take a piece of iron.  Once touched by a pãrasmani, it is \ntransformed into gold.  It cannot be transformed back into iron; not \neven by the pãrasmani itself.  Similarly, a person who has realised the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn cannot be made to fall from the holy feet of \nLOYÃ \n- 379 - \nBhagvãn, not even by Bhagvãn Himself.  Then, how could he be made \nto fall by any other object?  Of course he cannot. \n \n17.15 “In addition to realising the greatness of Bhagvãn, such a person also \ndeeply realises the greatness of a sant who worships Bhagvãn.  He \nfeels, ‘This sant is truly great because he is a true bhakta of Bhagvãn’.  \nFor example, Uddhav was very educated, but as he had understood \nthe greatness of Bhagvãn, he did not become arrogant due to his \nintelligence.  In fact, he yearned for the dust from the feet of the gopis, \nand therefore asked to be reborn as a vine.  The reason for this was \nthat he had witnessed the profound love the gopis had towards \nBhagvãn, whom even the shloks of the Veds seek.  So, how can a \nperson who realises the greatness of a sant of Bhagvãn hold any \narrogance before a sant?  Why could he not bow down to him?  In \nactual fact, he would behave as a dãs of a dãs before a sant.  Even if a \nsant were to repeatedly physically mistreat him, he would tolerate it \nand would believe, ‘It is my great fortune that I am bearing the hatred \nof such a sant.  Due to my prãrabdha, I would have been forced to \nendure the abuses of my wife and children, my parents, and the king.  I \nmay even have had to eat the leaves of spinach and moss.  At least here, \nin the company of the sant, I am fortunate enough to be able to keep \nthe vow of nisvãd.  Due to my prãrabdha, I may have been forced to \nwear tattered clothes or rags; but at least here with the sant I am \nfortunate enough to have a blanket to cover myself with’. \n \n17.16 “Conversely, if a person enters a sabhã of sãdhus and is not \nappropriately honoured by a sant, and if he then has a dislike \ntowards that sant, it implies that he has not realised the greatness of \nthe sant; otherwise he would not have a dislike towards the sant in \nthat way.  Consider the following as an example:  If the British \nGovernor of Mumbai were seated in an assembly, and if at that time a \npoor man were to enter that assembly, but was not given a seat or \nwelcomed in anyway, would the poor man become angry with the \nGovernor?  Would he feel like swearing at the Governor?  Not at all.  \nThis is because the poor man has realised the importance of the \nLOYÃ \n- 380 - \nBritish official, and thinks, ‘He is the ruler of the land, and I am a mere \npauper’.  For this reason, he does not become upset.  In the same way, \nif a person has realised the greatness of a sant, then regardless of \nhow much the sant hates him, he would never become upset with \nthat sant.  If fact, if he does find an avgun in anyone, he would find it \nin himself, but in no way would he perceive an avgun in the sant.  \nTherefore, a person who has realised the greatness of Bhagvãn and \nHis sant has a firm foundation in satsang.  Conversely, a person \ncannot be certain about someone who has not realised such \ngreatness.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 17 || 125 || \n \n \nLoyã – 18 \nNishchay In Bhagvãn \n \n18.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Posh sud 1 [5th January, \n1821], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead in Surã Khãchar’s darbãr in Loyã.  He was wearing a white \nkhes and a warm, red dagli.  In addition to this, He had covered \nHimself with a chofãl and a rajãi.

A sabhã of \nparamhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n18.2 Then, after the paramhans had finished the sandhyã ãrti and prayers, \nShreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please sing a kirtan.”  Then, Muktãnand Swãmi \nand some other paramhans sang kirtans while playing musical \ninstruments. \n \n18.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Please conclude the singing as I wish to \ntalk.  If any doubts arise in what I say, please ask.” \n \n18.4 So saying, He began, “To develop nishchay in Bhagvãn is more \ndifficult than anything else.  Also, as this topic of nishchay is \nLOYÃ \n- 381 - \nextremely complex, I am afraid of discussing it.  I feel, ‘Upon \ndiscussing this topic, what if someone was to misunderstand it?  What \nif, due to this discussion, any characteristic that a person may have \nfirmly developed were to be destroyed or uprooted?’  However, there is \nno alternative but to reveal this fact.  If a person does not interpret it \ncorrectly, many problems can arise.  But, until a person has not \nunderstood this fact, a great deficiency will remain in his \nunderstanding.  That is why I wish to deliver this talk. \n \n18.5 “When Bhagvãn assumed the svarup of Varãh, His svarup as a boar \nwas very ugly.  During the avatãr of Matsya, His svarup was exactly \nlike that of a fish.  During the Kurma avatãr, His svarup was exactly \nlike that of other turtles.  In the Nrusinh avatãr, His svarup was as \nfrightening as a lion.  During the Vãman avatãr, His svarup was like a \ndwarf, with short hands and legs, a board waist and a plump body.  \nDuring the Vyãs avatãr, He appeared black, with lots of body hair and \na foul body odour. \n \n18.6 “All those who attained Bhagvãn in whichever svarup He had taken, \nperformed dhyãn on that particular svarup.  As a result of that \nmeditation, they attained a svarup similar to that svarup of Bhagvãn.  \nNow, did those who attained Varãh, see Bhagvãn exactly like a boar \nin His dhãm?  Did those who attained Matsya, see Bhagvãn exactly \nlike a fish in His dhãm?  Did those who attained Kurma, see Bhagvãn \nexactly like a turtle in His dhãm?  Did those who attained Nrusinh see \nBhagvãn exactly like a lion in His dhãm?  Did those who attained \nHayagriv see Bhagvãn exactly as a horse in His dhãm?  Did those who \nworshipped Varãh as if He were their husband become a female \nboar?  Did those who worshipped Him with the love of a friend \nbecome a boar?  Did those who worshipped Matsya as if He were \ntheir husband become a female fish?  Did those who worshipped Him \nwith the love of a friend become a fish?  Did those who worshipped \nKurma as if He were their husband become a female turtle?  Did \nthose who worshipped Him with the love of a friend become a turtle?  \nDid those who worshipped Nrusinh as if He were their husband \nLOYÃ \n- 382 - \nbecome a lioness?  Did those who worshipped Him with the love of a \nfriend become a lion?  Did those who worshipped Hayagriv as if He \nwere their husband become a female horse?  Did those who \nworshipped Him with the love of a friend become a horse?  If the \noriginal svarup of Bhagvãn was exactly like that of the avatãr, then by \nmeditating on them, the bhaktas of each avatãr should attain that \nsame svarup, and all that I have just mentioned should happen.  \nHowever, this is not the case. \n \n18.7 “Then, you may ask, ‘What is the svarup of that Bhagvãn like?’  Well, \nthe answer is that Bhagvãn is sachidãnand, and possesses a murti full \nof divine light.  In every single pore of His body, there is light \nequivalent to millions and millions of suns.  Moreover, that Bhagvãn \nis so handsome that He puts even millions of Kãm-Devs to shame.  He \nis the lord of countless millions of brahmãnds, the king of kings, the \ncontroller of all, the antaryãmi of all, and extremely blissful.  In \ncomparison to His bliss, the pleasure of seeing countless beautiful \nwomen fades into insignificance.  In fact, before the bliss of the murti \nof the Bhagvãn, the pleasures of the vishays of this lok and the higher \nloks fade into insignificance.  Such is the svarup of Bhagvãn.  That \nsvarup always has two arms, but by His wish, He may appear to have \nfour arms, or sometimes may appear to have eight arms, or He may \neven be seen as having a thousand arms. \n \n18.8 “Furthermore, it is that very Bhagvãn who assumes the svarup such \nas Matsya, Kurma, Varãh, and the svarup of Rãm and Krishna, for the \npurpose of fulfilling some task.  However, he does not abandon His \noriginal svarup to assume the svarup of these avatãrs.  That Bhagvãn \nHimself assumes the svarups like Matsya and Kurma, possessing \ncountless divine powers and great strength.  Then, once the task for \nwhich He assumed a body is completed, He abandons that body.  For \nthis reason, it is said in the Shreemad Bhãgvat: \n \nbhu-bhãraha kshapito yena tãm tanum vijahãvajah \nkantakam kantakeneva dvayam chãpeeshituhu samama \n \nLOYÃ \n- 383 - \n“This shlok explains that through whichever physical body Bhagvãn \nrelieved the burden of the earth, after removing the ‘thorn’ (the belief \nthat a person is the body) which has pierced the chaitanya of the \nbeings, Bhagvãn also abandoned His own physical body, which was \nthe ‘thorn’ used to remove the other ‘thorn’. \n \n18.9 “Also, Bhagvãn assumed the svarup of Nrusinh for the purpose of \nkilling a demon.  After completing that task, He decided to abandon \nthat particular body.  But, who could kill a lion?  So, by Bhagvãn’s own \nwill, Shiv (in the form of Kãl), came assuming the svarup of a sharabh.  \nNrusinh then fought the sharabh.  As a result, both left their physical \nbodies.  That is how Shiv came to be known as Sharbheshvar \nMahãdev, and the location where Nrusinhji left his body became \nNãrsinhi Shilã. \n \n18.10 “Moreover, wherever paintings of Matsya, Kurma, and other avatãrs \nof Bhagvãn are portrayed, the lower portions of the paintings depict \nthe svarup as the avatãr, like a fish or a turtle.  However, the upper \nportions of the paintings depict the murti of Bhagvãn with a shankh, a \nchakra, a gadã, a padma, a vaijayanti garland, silk garments, a crown, \nand the shrivatsa mark, as well as other symbols.  Therefore, the \nmurti of Bhagvãn is eternally like this. \n \n18.11 “Initially, at the time of His birth, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn gave \ndarshan in a four-armed svarup to Vasudev and Devki.  He also gave \ndarshan to Akrur in water in a four-armed svarup.  When Rukmani \nfainted, He again gave darshan in a four-armed svarup.  Arjun has also \nsaid: \n \ntenaiva rupena chatur-bhujen sahasra-bãho bhava vishvamurte \nO one whose form is the svarup!  O thousand-armed!  \nPlease return to your original four-armed svarup! \n \n“So, Arjun also saw Him as having a four-armed svarup.  When Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn was seated under a pipal tree after the Yadavs had \nLOYÃ \n- 384 - \nslaughtered themselves, Uddhavji and Maitreya Rushi saw the svarup \nof Bhagvãn having four-arms, along with a shankh, a chakra, a gadã, a \npadma, and silk garments.  Moreover, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn was \ndark in complexion, yet His beauty is described as being capable of \nputting millions of Kãm-Devs to shame. \n \n18.12 “Therefore, although Bhagvãn appears to be like a human, the \npreviously mentioned luminosity and bliss are all inherent within \nHim.  A person who has the strengths of dhyãn, dhãrnã, and samãdhi, \nsees that very svarup of having the light of millions and millions of \nsuns; such a person does not need to resort to using a torch or an oil \nlamp.  Moreover, even though Bhagvãn is so luminous, the fact that \nthis divine light cannot be seen is due to Bhagvãn’s wish.  If Bhagvãn \nwished, ‘May the bhaktas see me full of divine light’, then that same \nsvarup would be seen as luminous.  So, a person who has the nishchay \nin Bhagvãn realises, ‘The divya powers, riches, and pãrshads of the \ndhãms of Golok, Vaikunth, Shvet-Dvip, and Brahmpur, all accompany \nBhagvãn.  Also, the bhaktas who serve Him include Rãdhikã and \nLakshmi’.  He sees Bhagvãn in such a glorious way.  However, those \nwho are fools see Him as a human.  Shree Krishna Bhagvãn has also \nmentioned in the Geetã: \n \navajãnanti mãm moodhã mãnusheem tanum-ãshritam \nparam bhãvam-ajãnanto mama bhoota-maheshvaram \nFools describe me as having a human svarup, but they do not realise my \nmagnificent svarup as the great lord of all beings. \n \n“Therefore, those who are fools fail to realise such greatness of \nBhagvãn; instead, they perceive human traits in Bhagvãn, seeing Him \nas a human like themselves. \n \n18.13  “What is meant by perceiving human characteristics?  Well, it is when \nall the feelings of the antah-karans, like kãm, krodh, lobh, moh, mad, \nmatsar, ãshã, trushnã; and all the characteristics of the physical body, \nlike bones, skin, faeces, and urine; as well as birth, childhood, youth, \nold age, and death; and all other human characteristics may appear to \nLOYÃ \n- 385 - \nhave a nishchay in Bhagvãn, but his nishchay is flawed.  As a result, he \nwill surely fall from satsang. \n \n18.14 “That Bhagvãn’s svarup is supremely divya – there is not even the \nslightest trace of human characteristics in Bhagvãn, and a person \nshould instead not perceive human traits in Bhagvãn, and he should \ninstead initially view Him as a dev; then he should view Him as \nBrahmã; then as Pradhãn-Purush; then as Prakruti-Purush; then as \nAkshar; and finally as Purushottam.  For example, upon seeing the \nincredible charitras of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, the cow-herds of Vraj \ninitially viewed Him as a dev.  Then, after listening to the words of \nGarg-Ãchãrya, they viewed Him as Bhagvãn.  Then, they said, ‘You are \nBhagvãn.  So, show us your dhãm’.  They were then shown \nAkshardhãm.  A person who believes Bhagvãn to be divya in this way \nshould be known to have to complete nishchay. \n \n18.15 “Sometimes people say, ‘Initially, this person did not have the nishchay \nin Bhagvãn, but now he does’.  Does that mean that he did not see \nBhagvãn initially?  Well, he certainly did see Him, but he perceived \nhuman characteristics in Him.  Later, after he develops nishchay, he \ndoes darshan believing Bhagvãn to be completely divya; that is \nknown as having developed the nishchay in Bhagvãn.  Moreover, if a \nperson does not believe Bhagvãn to be completely divya, then he \nrepeatedly becomes upset and constantly perceives gun and avgun.  \nHe thinks, ‘Bhagvãn is favouring that person, but not me’, or ‘He often \ncalls that person, but not me’, or ‘He has more love for that person, and \nless for me’.  In this way, he continues perceiving gun and avgun.  As a \nresult, his heart becomes more and more miserable day by day, and \nultimately he falls from satsang.  Therefore, a person should certainly \nnot perceive human characteristics in Bhagvãn. \n \n18.16 “A person should not perceive avgun even in the bhaktas of Bhagvãn.  \nThis is because physically a bhakta may be blind, disabled, deaf, old, \nunattractive, or he may have leukoderma; but when he dies, does he \nstill remain blind or disabled in the dhãm of Bhagvãn?  Certainly not.  \nLOYÃ \n- 386 - \nThose are all features of humans.  After leaving these features behind, \nhe assumes a divya svarup and becomes brahm-rup.  Therefore, if a \nperson should not perceive avgun in the bhaktas of Bhagvãn, then \nhow can he possibly perceive them in Bhagvãn? \n \n18.17 “Regardless of whether you understand this fact today or you \nunderstand it after a hundred years, it must be understood.  In actual \nfact, there is no alternative but to understand it and remember it \nfirmly.  Therefore, all bhaktas should remember this principle of \nmine and discuss it amongst each other.  Furthermore, whenever \nsomeone suffers a setback due to some misunderstanding, he should \nbe alerted by mentioning this.  A person should discuss this principle \nof mine regularly, at least once a day – this is my ãgnã.  So, please do \nnot forget it; please, please, do not forget it!” \n \n18.18 Saying this, Shreeji Mahãrãj bid “Jay Swãminarayan” to all the \nbhaktas and returned to His residence smiling.  After listening to \nShreeji Mahãrãj’s talk, all the sãdhus and bhaktas realised Shreeji \nMahãrãj is the cause of all avatãrs, the ‘avatãri’, and greatly \nstrengthened their nishchay in Him as being completely divya. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Loyã || 18 || 126 || \n \n \n|| End of Shree Loyã Prakaran ||\nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 387 - \n|| SHREE SWÃMINÃRAYAN VIJAYTETRÃM || \n \nVACHANÃMRUT \nShree Panchãlã Prakaran \n \nPanchãlã – 1 \nThe Happiness Of Akshardhãm \n \n1.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Fãgan sud 4 [3rd March 1821], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had been placed on \na platform in Jhinã-Bhãi’s darbãr in Panchãlã.  He was wearing a \nwhite angarkhu and a white khes.  He had tied a white feto around His \nhead, with its end hanging on the right side.  He had also covered \nHimself with a thin, white pachhedi.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n1.2 \nThen, after the sandhyã ãrti, Shreeji Mahãrãj sat on a large, \ncylindrical pillow and said, “I wish to ask a question to all these \nsenior paramhans and senior bhaktas:  A person may have love for \nBhagvãn, and also the determination to follow dharma.  However, if \nhe has not applied a thought process, then the extremely attractive \nvishays (shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh) will never be considered \nequivalent to the extremely repulsive vishays; nor will they be \nconsidered inferior to them.  So, which thought must be applied so \nthat the extremely attractive vishays seem equivalent to or inferior to \nthe extremely repulsive vishays?  I ask this question to all the senior \nbhaktas.  Whoever has, through whichever thought, realised the \nattractive vishays to be like the repulsive vishays, or has realised them \nto be far more repulsive than even the repulsive vishays, please \nreveal your thoughts.” \n \n1.3 \nThen, all the paramhans and all the bhaktas disclosed their thoughts. \n \n1.4 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Having heard your thoughts, I shall now \ntell you about the thought which I have maintained.  Consider the \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 388 - \nfollowing example:  If someone sends a letter from a distant land, the \nintelligence of the writer of that letter can be revealed by reading the \nletter.  Now, the appearance and style of speech of the five Pãndavs, \nDraupadi, Kuntãji, Rukmani, Satyabhãmã, Jambavati, and other \nqueens of Bhagvãn, of Bhagvãn’s son, Sãmb, and of other bhaktas, are \nwritten in the shãstras.  By hearing those shãstras, the description of \ntheir appearance allows us to visualise them as if having direct \ndarshan.  Also, their intelligence can be revealed from the words of \nthe shãstras.  In the same way, a person hears from the Purãns, the \nMahãbhãrat, and other shãstras that Bhagvãn is the all-doer – is \nresponsible for the creation, sustenance, and destruction of this \nuniverse – and that He eternally has a svarup.  If He did not have a \nsvarup, He could not be called the all-doer.  Furthermore, Akshar-\nBrahm is the dhãm in which Bhagvãn resides.  It is that Bhagvãn who \nhas a divya murti; who is luminous and blissful; and who, at the time \nof creation, gives a buddhi, indriyas, a man, and prãns to the jeevs that \nhad been merged in Mãyã along with their kãran bodies at the time of \ndestruction.  Why does He give these to the jeevs?  He does so to \nenable them to indulge in the uttam, madhyam, and kanishth types of \nvishays as well as for the purpose of attaining moksh. \n \n1.5 \n“Bhagvãn has created enjoyments and places of enjoyment for the \nsake of those jeevs; but within that, the creation of the uttam vishays \nare for the purpose of reducing the miseries of the inferior vishays.  \nFor example, a wealthy merchant may have had trees planted on \nboth sides of a road to provide shade; he may have had water-houses \nconstructed; he may have also had charity-houses and guest-homes \nconstructed.  He does all of this for the poor.  Similarly, before \nBhagvãn, Brahmã, Shiv, Indra, and other devs are as poor as those \npaupers of Samvat 1847 who boiled the fruits of pipal trees and then \nate them.  It is Bhagvãn who has created those uttam vishays for the \nhappiness of Brahmã and the other devs, and for humans.  Also, since \nthe rich merchant builds facilities for the sake of the poor, it is \nobvious that compared to those, the luxuries in the merchant’s own \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 389 - \nhome must be far greater.  Similarly, Bhagvãn has created happiness \nfor Brahmã and others; so it is obvious to an intelligent person that \ncompared to those, the bliss of His own dhãm must be far more \nsuperior.  An intelligent person can then conclude that there is an \nextreme amount of bliss in the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  As a result, the \nattractive vishays become repulsive for him. \n \n1.6 \n“Furthermore, all the happiness related to vishays which is apparent \nin this world, be it for animals, humans, devs, or ghosts, is only due to \nsome relation with Bhagvãn, and when the happiness is coupled with \ndharma.  However, the bliss that is in Bhagvãn Himself cannot be \nfound anywhere else.  Consider the following example:  The light \nfrom this burning torch which falls a short distance away is not as \nintense as the light in the vicinity of the torch.  Very far away, there is \nnot light at all.  In the same way, elsewhere there is only a little bliss, \nbut absolute bliss is only available in the vicinity of Bhagvãn.  The \nfurther a person is distanced from Bhagvãn, the less bliss he \nexperiences.  Therefore, a person who is a mumukshu realises, ‘The \nfurther away I am from Bhagvãn, the more miseries I will face, and \nultimately I will become extremely miserable.  On the other hand, even \nthe slightest association with Bhagvãn will provide immense bliss.  I \nshall experience the highest form of bliss’.  A person who thinks in this \nway, keeps a desire for the bliss of Bhagvãn, and employs any means \nto maintain very close association with Bhagvãn, can be called \nintelligent. \n \n1.7 \n“Moreover, the happiness of humans exceeds the happiness of \nanimals; and the happiness of a king exceeds that; and the happiness \nof Indra exceeds that; then Bruhaspati’s happiness, then Brahmã’s, \nthen Vaikunth’s.  Beyond that, the happiness of Golok is superior, and \nfinally, the bliss of Bhagvãn’s Akshardhãm is far more superior. \n \n1.8 \n“In this way, realising the intensity of the bliss of Bhagvãn, a person \nwho is intelligent realises all other pleasures related to vishays to be \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 390 - \ninsignificant.  Compared to the bliss of Bhagvãn, the pleasures of \nothers are like that of a poor man who begs with a clay pot at the \ndoor of a rich grahastha.  When I think of the bliss of the dhãm of that \nBhagvãn, I become uninterested in all other forms of happiness, and I \nfeel, ‘When will I leave this body to experience that bliss?’  Moreover, \nwhen I naturally indulge in the panch-vishays, I think about no \nparticular thought; but, if I were to sense some pleasure in an object, \nmy thoughts would immediately be diverted to the bliss of Bhagvãn, \nand my mind would become extremely uninterested. \n \n1.9 \n“These thoughts can only be fully realised by a person who is \nintelligent.  In fact, I have love towards a person who is intelligent.  \nThis is because I myself am intelligent, as is my thought process.  \nMoreover, a person who is intelligent will also think similarly.  In this \nway, it appears to me that my thought is superior to all of your \nthoughts; therefore, all of you should firmly remember this thought \nof mine in your hearts.  Without applying this thought, if a person’s \nvrutti does become attached to appealing vishays, it will only just \nbecome detached – and only after much effort.  However, for a person \nwho has applied this thought, very little effort is involved in \nwithdrawing his vrutti; he can easily realise how worthless the \nvishays are. \n \n1.10 “This fact can only be understood by a person who has a sharp \nintelligence, and a craving for higher happiness.  For example, a \npenny is worth more than a cowry-shell, and a rupee is worth more \nthan a penny; a gold coin is more valuable than a rupee, and a \nchintãmani is more valuable than a gold coin.  Similarly, wherever \nthere are pleasures of the panch-vishays, the bliss of Bhagvãn in His \ndhãm is far more superior in comparison.  Therefore, this thought \nonly settles in the heart of a person who is intelligent and who thinks \nin this way.  When this thought does firmly settle in the heart, even if \nhe happens to be in a forest, he would feel, ‘I am surrounded by \ncountless people and the wealth of the kingdom’, and he would not \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 391 - \nbelieve himself to be miserable.  Conversely, if he were in Indra’s lok, \nhe would feel, ‘I am sitting in a forest’, and he would not be gratified \nby the pleasures in the lok of Indra.  In fact, he would realise those \npleasures to be worthless. \n \n1.11 “Therefore, keeping this thought in mind, all of you should decide, \n‘Now we want to reach only the dhãm of Bhagvãn; we do not want to \nbe tempted by the worthless pleasures of the panch-vishays along the \nway’.  So, please keep this determination in your mind, as what I have \ntold all of you is my principle; please embed it firmly in your lives.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Panchãlã || 1|| 127 || \n \n \nPanchãlã – 2 \nSãnkhya And Yog \n \n2.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Fãgan sud 7 [10th March, 1821], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had been placed on \na platform in Jhinã-Bhãi’s darbãr in Panchãlã.  He was wearing a \nwhite khes and had covered Himself with a white pachhedi.  He had \nalso tied a white feto around His head.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well \nas haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n2.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please bring the Moksh-Dharma shãstras \nso that we can arrange for a kathã on the chapter of Sãnkhya and the \nchapter of Yog.”  Then, the shãstras were brought to the sabhã, and \nNityãnand Swãmi commenced the reading. \n \n2.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then said, “The followers of Yog consider jeev and \nishvar to be the twenty-fifth tattva, and Paramãtmã to be the twenty-\nsixth tattva.  On the other hand, followers of Sãnkhya include jeev and \nishvar with the twenty-four tattvas, and consider Paramãtmã to be \nthe twenty-fifth tattva.  Of the two, the followers of Yog believe that \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 392 - \nregardless of however much a person thinks of the ãtmã and non-\nãtmã, or however much effort he makes, without accepting the refuge \nof pratyaksha Bhagvãn, he cannot attain moksh.  On the other hand, \nfollowers of Sãnkhya believe that if a person understands the \nultimate fate of all devs and humans, develops vairãgya for the \nvishays, and realises his ãtmã as greater than the three bodies (sthul, \nsukshma, kãran), then he becomes a mukta.  However, since each of \nthese two types of beliefs has their own deficiencies, a person should \nemploy certain methods of understanding for the purpose of \nresolving those deficiencies. \n \n2.4 \n“The flaw of the Yog philosophy is that both the jeev and ishvar have \nbeen considered as the twenty-fifth tattva and both have been said to \nhave bodies comprised of twenty-four tattvas.  As a result, both the \njeev and ishvar seem equal.  This would suggest that the sthul body is \nthe same as virãt, the sukshma body is the same as sutrãtmã, and the \nkãran body is the same as avyãkrut.  It also suggests that the jãgrat \nstate is the same as that of sustenance, the svapna state is the same as \nthat of creation, and the sushupti state is the same as that of \ndestruction.  Moreover, vishva, taijas, and prãgna, would be \nconsidered equal to Vishnu, Brahmã, and Shiv respectively.  As a \nresult, those followers would worship the twenty-sixth tattva with \nsuch understanding. \n \n2.5 \n“To remove this deficiency of equating jeev and ishvar, a person \nshould learn the following method of interpretation from a wise \nperson:  The five bhuts residing in the body of ishvar are known as \nmahã-bhuts, and those bhuts sustain the bodies of all jeevs.  On the \nother hand, the five bhuts in the body of the jeev are minor and are \nincapable of sustaining others.  Also, the jeev possesses limited \nknowledge compared to ishvar, who is all-knowing.  A person should \nlearn such a method of interpretation so that the jeev and ishvar are \nnot understood to be equal to each other.  If a person has not done \nthat and some opponent were to ask a question in a debate, then he \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 393 - \nwould find it difficult to reply.  As a result, his own understanding \nwould become confused.  But, if he has learnt such a method, then \neven if someone were to raise a question, he would not allow the jeev \nand ishvar to be considered as being equal.  Also, he should only \nlisten to words that strengthen this belief. \n \n2.6 \n“Next, the flaw of the followers of the Sãnkhya philosophy is that they \nconsider Paramãtmã to be the twenty-fifth tattva, who is greater \nthan the twenty-four tattvas.  They consider the twenty-four tattvas \nas being false and Paramãtmã as being satya.  If that were so, who \nwould attain that Paramãtmã?  After all, the jeev, who is the achiever, \nis not considered distinct from the tattvas.   \n \n2.7 \n“To remove that deficiency, a person should learn the following \nmethod of interpretation from a wise person:  Jeev and ishvar have \nbeen included with the tattvas because those twenty-four tattvas \ncannot exist without the jeev and ishvar.  But, in reality, jeev and \nishvar are distinct from those tattvas, and do attain Paramãtmã.  A \nperson should learn such a method of interpretation.  If he has not \ndone so, and an opponent in a debate were to ask a question, doubts \nwould arise, and he would think, ‘If the tattvas are truly false, then \nwhat is the purpose of prescribing the observance of dharma, such as \nbrahm-chãrya, and spiritual activities such as shravan, manan, and \nnididhyãs, to attain Paramãtmã?’  Therefore, jeev and ishvar have \nbeen included with the tattvas because they have attained oneness \nwith the tattvas; however, they are totally distinct from those tattvas \nand do attain Paramãtmã.  In this way, followers of the Sãnkhya \nphilosophy should learn such methods of interpretation from a wise \nsãdhu. \n \n2.8 \n“Moreover, the followers of Yog propose the following methods: \nMoksh is attained by performing dhyãn on the pratyaksha murtis of \nthe avatãrs of Bhagvãn such as Matsya, Kurma, Varãh, Nrusinh, \nVãman, Rãm, and Krishna.  However, the followers of Sãnkhya accept \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 394 - \nmethods which claim that moksh is attained when a person fully \nrealises the svarup of Bhagvãn, through experience, as described by \nthe various Shruti shãstras: \n \nyato vãcho nivartante aprãpya manasã saha \nFrom where speech returns along with the mind without having attained \nBhagvãn. \n \n \n“Both philosophies are good and have been accepted by the great, \nand a person who follows both of them appropriately does attain \nAkshardhãm.  In both of these philosophies, the same spiritual \nactivities have been prescribed, but the method of worship in each is \nnot the same; in fact, it is extremely different.” \n \n2.9 \nHaving spoken in this way, Shreeji Mahãrãj then told the paramhans, \n“Now please sing kirtans.” \n \n2.10 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi and some other paramhans began singing \nkirtans to the accompaniment of musical instruments.  Following this, \nShreeji Mahãrãj said, “Now, please stop the kirtans.  While you were \nsinging, I thought over the philosophies of both Sãnkhya and Yog.  \nPlease listen as I explain. \n \n2.11 “For a person who follows Yog, the luminous, divya svarup murti of \nBhagvãn which resides in Akshardhãm at the time of ãtyantik-pralay \nis worthy of performing dhyãn upon.  Moreover, Bhagvãn in the form \nof Prakruti-Purush is also worthy of performing dhyãn upon, but to a \nlesser extent.  To a lesser extent than that, Bhagvãn in the form of the \ntwenty-four tattvas, which have evolved from Prakruti-Purush, is also \nworthy of performing dhyãn upon.  To a lesser extent than that, \nHiranyagarbh; and to a lesser extent than that, Virãt – who has \nevolved from the twenty-four tattvas – is also worthy of performing \ndhyãn upon.  Still to a lesser extent than that, Brahmã, Vishnu, and \nShiv, as well as the avatãrs of Bhagvãn on this earth, such as Matsya, \nKurma, Nrusinh, and Varãh, as well as shãligrãm and other murtis of \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 395 - \nBhagvãn – are all worthy of performing dhyãn upon.  While I was \nthinking, I realised that this is the essence of the philosophy of Yog. \n \n2.12 “Then, I thought over the Sãnkhya philosophy.  They have done away \nwith all those svarups, and it appears that they believe, ‘The cause of \nall thoughts is the jeev, and since there is nothing as pure as the jeev, it \nis appropriate to perform dhyãn upon the jeev’.  In order to disprove \nthis view of Sãnkhya, I again thought of Yog.  Specifically, \nPurushottam Bhagvãn, who is greater than everything, has an anvay \nrelationship with Prakruti and Purush and all other entities.  \nTherefore, they are all Bhagvãn; all possess a divya svarup; all are \nsatya and worthy of performing dhyãn upon.  Certain Vedic shloks \nalso support this fact:   \n \nsarvam khalvidam brahma \nThe whole universe is brahm, the svarup of Bhagvãn. \n \nneha nãnãsti kinchana \nThere is nothing in this universe that is not the svarup of Bhagvãn. \n \nidam hi vishvam bhagavãn-ivetaro yato jagat-sthãna-nirodha-sambhavãha \nThis universe is as another svarup of Bhagvãn – who is the cause of the \ncreation, sustenance, and destruction of the world. \n \n2.13 “Therefore, a mumukshu who follows the path of Yog encounters no \nobstacles.  This is because that path is easy and relies on the \npratyaksha murti of Bhagvãn.  For this reason, through that path, \neven an ordinary person can attain kalyãn without any difficulty. \n \n2.14 “However, there is one flaw on that path:  Entities, such as Prakruti \nand Purush, are thought of as being the components of Purushottam \nBhagvãn.  This could cause the following belief to develop: Prakruti \nand Purush are components of Bhagvãn, and their components are \nHiranyagarbh and Virãt.  If such an understanding develops, then that \nis a major flaw since a person feels Bhagvãn is divisible and has \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 396 - \ncomponents.  However, Bhagvãn is indivisible, without components, \nunchanging, \nimperishable, \nand \nwhole. \n \nTherefore, \nsuch \na \nmisunderstanding should not be allowed to arise. \n \n2.15 “Also, a person should understand, ‘Bhagvãn is one and unparalleled, \nwhile others, such as Prakruti and Purush, are His bhaktas and perform \ndhyãn upon Him.  That is why they are referred to as svarups of \nBhagvãn.  Just as a great sãdhu who performs dhyãn upon Bhagvãn is \nknown as a svarup of Bhagvãn, in the same way Prakruti and Purush \nare also svarups of Bhagvãn.  Moreover, Purushottam Shree Krishna, \nwho is greater than everything, Himself assumes the forms of Vãsudev, \nSankarshan, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha, and assumes avatãrs such as \nRam and Krishna.  Therefore, He is worthy of performing dhyãn upon’.  \nIf a person has such an understanding, then that path of Yog is \nabsolutely free of obstacles and is the best path. \n \n2.16 “Now, the flaw of the Sãnkhya philosophy is that it claims, ‘All that is \ngrasped via the antah-karans and the indriyas is false, while all that is \ngrasped through experience is satya’.  Therefore, they propose all \nsvarups as being false.  Along with that, they also consider the svarups \nof Bhagvãn that have incarnated for the kalyãn of the jeevs, as being \nfalse.  In fact, they also view the svarups of Aniruddha, Pradyumna, \nand Sankarshan as being false.  They only accept Vãsudev, who is \nnirgun.  That is their major flaw. \n \n2.17 “Therefore, it suits the followers of Sãnkhya to believe, ‘After \nabsorbing the thoughts of Sãnkhya and considering whatever has \nevolved from Prakruti and Purush as being perishable, a person should \nrealise his own ãtmã as being distinct from all, as being pure, and \nbrahm-rup.  Then, understanding the svarup of Bhagvãn that has \nincarnated for the kalyãn of the jeevs as being satya, he should perform \ndhyãn upon Him’.  In this way, these two types of thoughts can be \nknown if a person learns from someone who is wise, like myself; \notherwise, even if a person studies or listens to the shãstras, he \ncannot understand them. \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 397 - \n2.18 “In reality, the teachings of Yog are actually for a person who has \nbecome brahm-rup by initially having practiced thoughts of Sãnkhya.  \nTherefore, it is said: \n \nbrahma-bhutaha prasannãtmã na shochati na kãnkshati \nsamaha sarveshu bhuteshu mad-bhaktim labhate parãm \nA person who has become brahm-rup remains joyful, grieves nothing, desires \nnothing, behaves equally with all beings, and attains my supreme bhakti. \n \nãtmãrãmash-cha munayo nirgranthã apyurukrame \nkurvantya-haitukeem bhakti-mittham-bhuta-guno hariha \nDespite being engaged only in the ãtmã, and despite having overcome all \nimproper natures – the munis still offer selfless bhakti to Bhagvãn, as Bhagvãn \npossesses such divya qualities. \n \nparinishthitopi nairgunya uttam-shloka-leelayã \ngruheeta-chetã rãjarshe ãkhyanam yad-adheetavãn \nO King (Parikshit)!  Despite being perfectly poised in the nirgun state, having \nbeen attracted by the leelãs of Bhagvãn, I (Shukdevji) studied the Shreemad \nBhãgvat. \n \n2.19 “In this way, the Sãnkhya philosophy is dependent on Yog.  This is \nbecause through that Sãnkhya philosophy, the followers of Sãnkhya \nrealise all vishays that can be indulged in via the five indriyas and four \nantah-karans – which are distinct from a person’s own ãtmã – to be \ntotally worthless.  Therefore, such a person is not tempted by any \nobjects, nor does he become attached to them.  Moreover, if someone \nwere to say to him, ‘This object is extremely pleasurable’, he would \nthink, ‘It may be pleasurable, but it is perceived through the indriyas \nand antah-karans; and that which the indriyas and antah-karans \nperceive is asatya and perishable’.  This is the firm understanding of a \nfollower of Sãnkhya, who also realises his own ãtmã as pure.  Such a \nperson should perform dhyãn, upãsanã, and offer bhakti to Bhagvãn \naccording to the path of Yog.  If he does not adopt this, that would be \na major flaw in him. \n \n2.20 “In this way, I have described the eternal philosophies of the Sãnkhya \nshãstras and the Yog shãstras having thoroughly thought about them.  \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 398 - \nHowever, the followers of Yog and Sãnkhya have corrupted both \npaths.  Those who are followers of Yog try to establish the truth of \nsvarups, and in the process they realise all people, the svarups of \nBrahmã, Vishnu, and Shiv, as well as svarups of Rãm, Krishna, and \nother avatãrs as equal to each other.  Followers of Sãnkhya criticise \nall svarups, and in the process they also criticise places of pilgrimage, \nvrat, murtis, yam and niyam, forms of dharma such as brahm-chãrya, \nas well as Brahmã, Vishnu, and Shiv, and Rãm, Krishna, and other \navatãrs.  Therefore, both the followers of Sãnkhya and the followers \nof Yog have deviated from the correct path.  As a result, they will be \nsent to Narak.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Panchãlã || 2 || 128 || \n \n \nPanchãlã – 3 \nIntelligence Is Instrumental In Attaining Kalyãn \nLove Is Mãyã \n \n3.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Fãgan sud 8 [11th March, 1821], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in Jhinã-Bhãi’s darbãr in \nPanchãlã.  He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself \nwith a white pachhedi.  He had also tied a white feto around His head.  \nA sabhã of paramhans, as well as a sabhã of haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \n \n3.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said to the paramhans, “Please begin a \nquestion-answer discussion.” \n \n3.3 \nThen, Muni Bãvã asked Brahmãnand Swãmi, “We have attained this \nsatsang, as well as the association of Bhagvãn.  All other flaws have \nbeen eradicated, and we also have enthusiasm to do satsang.  Despite \nthis, why do mãn and irshyã still remain?” \n \n3.4 \nBrahmãnand Swãmi then began to supply an answer, but was unable \nto do so satisfactorily. \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 399 - \n3.5 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Such a person lacks intelligence.  This is \nbecause a person who is intelligent realises all of his gun and avgun, \nas well as the gun and avgun of others.  On the other hand, a person \nwho is not intelligent only acknowledges his own gun, but fails to \nrealise his avgun; he feels himself to be as distinguished as the \nSanakãdik, and he views other renowned people to be inferior to \nhimself.  However, a person who is intelligent realises his own avgun, \nand thinks ‘I possess many avgun.  Then, maintaining an intense \nhatred towards those avgun, he eradicates them.  Also, if a sãdhu \nwere to speak to him about eradicating those avgun, he would accept \nthat advice as beneficial.  As a result, avgun, such as mãn and irshyã, \nwill not remain in him.  \n \n3.6 \n“On the other hand, someone may appear to be very intelligent, but if \nhe does not recognise his own flaws, then his intelligence should be \nknown to be merely worldly.  Outwardly, that intelligence appears to \nbe very sharp, but he cannot be called intelligent.  Actually, he should \nbe known to be an utter fool, and his intelligence is useless for \nattaining his own moksh.  In comparison, someone else may possess \nonly a little intelligence, but if he attempts to eradicate his avgun \nafter recognising them, then even his limited intelligence is useful in \nattaining moksh.  In fact, only he can be called intelligent.  Therefore, \na person who never perceives his own avgun and perceives only his \nown gun should be known as a fool; and a person who acknowledges \nhis own avgun should be known to be intelligent.” \n \n3.7 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj instructed, “Now, please sing kirtans.”  The \nparamhans then commenced singing ‘Sakhi Ãj Mohan Deethã Re, \nSheriye Ãvta Re…’.” \n \n3.8 \nFollowing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj spoke again, “Now, please stop the \nsinging.  The kirtans that you have just sung are full of love.  While \nyou were singing, I thought about the nature of love, and realised that \nlove is a great quality; and to worship Bhagvãn with love is \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 400 - \nadmirable.  After deep thought, I realised, ‘Love itself is the mãyã of \nBhagvãn’.  This is because if two women are casually talking to each \nother, looking at each other, or casually touching each other, then \nthat is a different type of love.  Or, if two men are talking to each \nother, looking at each other, or casually touching each other, then \nthat is also a different type of love.  However, if a man is looking at a \nwoman, embracing her, listening to her talks, and enjoying her \nfragrance, then the love and mental attraction he develops for her is a \ntype of love that does not develop between two men.  Also, if a \nwoman is looking at a man and embracing him, then the love she \ndevelops for him through his association, with her mind being totally \nattracted towards him, is a type of love that does not develop \nbetween two women.  Therefore, that which is the cause of the \ncontinuance of the world, and the cause of bondage and the cycle of \nbirths and deaths, is the mãyã of Bhagvãn, which takes the form of \nlove. \n \n3.9 \n“Then, I thought, ‘Shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh are the panch-\nvishays.  After having regarded everything else as perishable, if those \nvishays are directed only towards Bhagvãn, realising Him to be the only \nsource of ultimate bliss, then that is fine – that is not mãyã’.  But, then I \nthought that even that is not appropriate.  After all, if a person \nperceives shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh, to be better in other \nobjects compared to those that are in Bhagvãn, he will abandon \nBhagvãn and will develop love for other objects.  For example, Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn’s 16,100 wives, who were apsãrãs in past lives, had \nasked for the following vardãn from Brahmã:  ‘O Mahãrãj!  We have \nexperienced the touch of devs, demons, and humans, but we have not \nexperienced the touch of Bhagvãn as our husband.  Therefore, please \ngrace us so that He becomes our husband’.  So, Brahmã replied, \n‘Perform tap and Bhagvãn will become your husband’.  So, they \nperformed intense tap, after which Ashtãvakra Rushi and Nãrad Muni \nboth became pleased and granted the following vardãn:  ‘Bhagvãn \nwill become your husband’.  In this way, by performing many tap in \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 401 - \nother lives, they attained Shree Krishna Bhagvãn.  However, on \nperceiving more beauty in Sãmb than in Bhagvãn, they became \ninfatuated by Sãmb.  Therefore, it is not appropriate for a person \nwhose mind is not steady to develop love for Bhagvãn through the \npleasures of the vishays of the five indriyas.  However, if a person’s \nmind does remain steady, without having any doubts, then it is \nappropriate. \n \n3.10 “Moreover, a person who is intelligent should develop love for \nBhagvãn in the following way:  A person should realise his jeev as \nbeing distinct from the twenty-four tattvas.  Then, after uprooting the \nvruttis of the five indriyas that are firmly embedded in the jeev, and \nwhile remaining as the jeev alone (without vruttis of the indriyas) he \nshould remain nirgun and develop as much love for Bhagvãn as \npossible. \n \n3.11 “What do I mean by nirgun?  Well, the ten indriyas are the products of \nrajo-gun; the antah-karans and their presiding devs are the products \nof sattva-gun; and the five bhuts and the panch-vishays are the \nproducts of tamo-gun.  A person who believes himself to be distinct \nfrom the products of those three gun and from the three gun \nthemselves, and remains as the jeev alone, is known as nirgun.  So, he \nshould become nirgun in this way and develop love of Bhagvãn.  \nTherefore, it is said: \n \nnairgunyasthã ramante sma gunãnu-kathane hareha \nAlthough the munis had attained the nirgun state, they still engaged \nthemselves in praising the glory of Bhagvãn.  \n \nparinishthitopi nairgunya uttam-shloka-leelayã \ngruheeta-chetã rãjarshe ãkhyanam yad-adheetavãn \nO King (Parikshit)!  Despite being perfectly poised in the nirgun state, having \nbeen attracted by the leelãs of Bhagvãn, I (Shukdevji) studied the Shreemad \nBhãgvat. \n \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 402 - \n3.12 “Those who possess gnãn after having realised the nature of the \nkshetra and the kshetragna attain ãtmã-nishthã and develop love for \nBhagvãn.  What is the kshetra?  Well, the three bodies (sthul, \nsukshma, and kãran) and the three mental states (jãgrat, svapna, and \nsushupti), are the kshetra.  Such a person realises the kshetra to be \ndistinct from his own ãtmã, and he feels, ‘Those can never be any part \nof me; I am the knower; I am extremely pure, formless, genderless, and \nchetan, while the kshetra is extremely impure, jad, and perishable’.  \nUnderstanding this firmly, a person who develops vairãgya towards \neverything else, and offers bhakti to Bhagvãn while following \nsvadharma, is known to possess ekãntik bhakti and gnãn.  A bhakta \npossessing this gnãn is superior to all.  In fact, Bhagvãn has said: \n \nteshãm gnãnee nitya-yukta eka-bhaktir-vishishyate \npriyo hi gnãnino tyartha-maham sa cha mama priyaha \nOf these – a person who is distressed from having fallen from the path of \nattaining siddh-dashã, and therefore still wishes to attain them; a person who \nseeks knowledge of the ãtmã; a person who desires material objects, material \npleasures and powers; and a person who has gnãn – the person with gnãn is \nthe best, as he is always engaged in me and is devoted to me alone.  I am \nexceedingly dear to a person with gnãn, and he is dear to me. \n \nudãrãha sarva evaite gnãnee tvãtmaiva me matam \nThey are all noble, but I consider the one with gnãn to be my very ãtmã. \n \n3.13 “Realising this, a person should uproot the indriyas, the antah-karans, \nand the vishays from the jeev, and develop love for Bhagvãn – only \nthat is appropriate.  As long as a person has not uprooted them, he \nshould extract work from them in the form of the darshan or touch of \nBhagvãn.  Moreover, they should not be regarded as supporters; \ninstead, they should be regarded as enemies.  In fact, a person should \nnever feel gratitude towards them by thinking, ‘They are beneficial to \nme in offering bhakti to Bhagvãn’.  He should not feel that the eyes \nenable a person to listen to the kathã of Bhagvãn; the skin enables a \nperson to experience the touch of Bhagvãn; the nose enables a \nperson to experience the fragrance of Bhagvãn’s mãlã and tulsi; the \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 403 - \nmouth enables a person to engage in kathãs and sing kirtans in praise \nof Bhagvãn; and the tongue enables a person to experience the taste \nof Bhagvãn’s prasãd.  A person should not understand them to be \nhelpful in performing bhakti of Bhagvãn.  They should not be given \ngratitude, nor should they be trusted.  Instead, they should be \nregarded only as enemies.  This is because what if in the process of \nexperiencing happiness through the darshan or touch of Bhagvãn, \nthey lure a person to believe that there is pleasure in the darshan or \ntouch of women and other objects?  That would be very damaging.  \nTherefore, those enemies (the five indriyas) should be confined, and \nwork in the form of bhakti to Bhagvãn should be extracted from \nthem.  For example, a king who has captured his enemy keeps him \nchained and extracts work from him; never does the king free him or \ntrust him.  If he were to free him or trust him, then the enemy would \ndefinitely kill the king.  In the same way, if a person trusts his \nenemies (the indriyas), and frees them and does not keep them \nconfined, they will definitely make him fall from the path of Bhagvãn.  \nTherefore, they should never be trusted. \n \n3.14 “Also, just as the British arrest a criminal and keep him standing in a \nwitness box to question him, without freeing him or trusting him, in \nthe same way, the indriyas and the antah-karans should be kept in a \nwitness box and in chains (the niyams of the panch-vartmãn), and \nthen they should be made to offer bhakti to Bhagvãn.  However, they \nshould not be given any gratitude; they should be looked upon only \nas enemies.  If the indriyas and the antah-karans are regarded as \nsupporters, given gratitude, and seen to be useful in bhakti, then in \nthe process of experiencing the happiness of the darshan or touch of \nBhagvãn, they will lure a person to believe that there is some \npleasure in women and other objects.  As a result, all efforts he has \nmade will become useless.  For example, if one spark of fire were to \nfall on a large pile of gunpowder, then that gunpowder would be \ncompletely reduced to ashes.  In this way, the stability of a person’s \nindriyas is not certain. \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 404 - \n3.15 “Therefore, it is only appropriate that a person develops love for \nBhagvãn while behaving as the ãtmã.  That is my principle, and a \nperson who develops love for Bhagvãn in this way is dear to me.  \nMoreover, he should think, ‘The beauty of Bhagvãn cannot be found \nanywhere else; the touch of Bhagvãn cannot be found anywhere else; \nthe bliss experienced from hearing Bhagvãn cannot be found anywhere \nelse; and the tastes related to Bhagvãn cannot be found anywhere else’.  \nIn this way, a person should tempt the indriyas and the antah-karans, \nand divert them away from other vishays.  This understanding is \nappropriate.” \n \n3.16 Then, Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi said, “Mahãrãj, in which place \nshould a person stay and develop all these thoughts?” \n \n3.17 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person should think:  ‘I am not the sthul \nbody, the sukshma body, or the kãran body; I do not have the jãgrat, \nsvapna, or sushupti states; I am not the five gnãn-indriyas, the five \nkarma-indriyas, the four antah-karans or their presiding devs; in fact, I \nam distinct from all these.  I am chaitanya; I am a bhakta of Bhagvãn’.  \nIf the indriyas and antah-karans misbehave in some way, they should \nbe disciplined in the following way:  ‘Do you wish to see the beauty \nonly of Bhagvãn, or do you also wish to see the beauty of others?  Do \nyou wish to listen to sounds related only to Bhagvãn and experience \nsmells related to Him, or do you also wish to listen to other sounds and \nexperience other smells?  If you do crave after the vishays leaving \nBhagvãn aside, then what is there between you and me?  Who are you \nand who am I?  I will have absolutely nothing to do with you.  Whatever \nyou do, you will have to bear the consequences’. \n \n3.18 “Lecturing the indriyas and antah-karans in this way, a person should \npray to Bhagvãn:  ‘O Mahãrãj!  O Swãmi!  You intensely love your \nbhaktas!  You are an ocean of mercy!  The fault lies with the indriyas \nand antah-karans.  I am distinct from them.  In fact, they are my \nenemies.  So, please protect me from their influence’.  A person should \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 405 - \nconstantly offer prayers in this way; and understanding his own \nkshetragna to be composed of chaitanya, he should offer love and \nbhakti to Bhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Panchãlã || 3 || 129 || \n \n \nPanchãlã – 4 \nPerceiving Divinity In The Human Traits Of Bhagvãn \n \n4.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Fãgan vad 3 [21st March, 1821], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had been placed on \na platform in Jhinã-Bhãi’s darbãr in Panchãlã.  He was wearing a \nwhite khes and had covered Himself with a white pachhedi.  He had \nalso tied a white feto around His head.  In addition to this, He was \nturning a mãlã of tulsi beads in His hand.  A sabhã of paramhans, as \nwell as haribhaktas from various places, was gathered before Him. \n \n4.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said to the paramhans, “Please begin a \nquestion-answer discussion amongst yourselves.” \n \n4.3 \nThen, Muni Bãvã asked a question to Brahmãnand Swãmi, “Initially, a \nperson may have the belief of Bhagvãn and may engage in bhajan and \nsmaran; but later, on seeing the human-like actions of Bhagvãn, \ndoubts arise in that belief.  What is the cause of this?” \n \n4.4 \nBrahmãnand Swãmi then began to answer that question but was \nunable to do so satisfactorily. \n \n4.5 \nThen, having thought for some time, Shreeji Mahãrãj spoke, “I shall \nanswer that question.”  Continuing, He said, “The Veds, the Purãns, \nthe Mahãbhãrat, the Smrutis, and the other shãstras state that the \noriginal svarup of Bhagvãn, which is eternal, without a beginning, and \ndivya, resides in His Akshardhãm.  They also mention what that \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 406 - \nBhagvãn is like.  His svarup is not like any svarup that can be seen by \nthe eyes; His sound is not like any sound that can be heard by the \nears; His touch is not like any touch that can be felt by the skin; His \nsmell is not like any smell that can be smelt by the nose; and the \ntongue cannot describe that Bhagvãn.  He cannot be imagined by the \nman; He cannot be thought of by the chitt; He cannot be understood \nby the buddhi; nor can the ahankãr fully claim, ‘I am Bhagvãn’s and \nBhagvãn is mine’.  In this way, Bhagvãn remains beyond the reach of \nthe indriyas and the antah-karans. \n \n4.6 \n“Moreover, the beauty of Bhagvãn is such that it cannot be compared \nto any other object in this brahmãnd – including everything from \nBrahmã to the smallest blade of grass; His sound is such that it \ncannot be compared to any other sounds in this brahmãnd; The smell \nof Bhagvãn is such that it cannot be compared to any other smell in \nthis brahmãnd; The touch of Bhagvãn is such that it cannot be \ncompared to any other touch in this brahmãnd; The tastes related to \nBhagvãn are such that they cannot be compared to any other taste in \nthe brahmãnd; and the dhãm of Bhagvãn is such that it cannot be \ncompared to any other place in this brahmãnd.  Specifically, out of all \nthe various places in the seven dvips and the nine khands, the \nextremely beautiful places of Brahmã and others on Mount Meru, the \nvarious places on Mount Lokã-Lok, the loks of Indra, Varun, Kuber, \nShiv, and Brahmã, and many other places, not one of them can \ncompare to the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  The bliss experienced by the \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn residing in that dhãm is such that it cannot be \ncompared to any other type of bliss in this brahmãnd. \n \n4.7 \n“The svarup of that Bhagvãn is such that it cannot be compared to the \nsvarup of anyone in this brahmãnd.  This is because all the svarups in \nthis brahmãnd which evolved from Prakruti and Purush are mãyik, \nwhereas Bhagvãn is divya.  So, since the two are totally different, how \ncan they possibly be compared?  For example, we can compare a \nperson to something by saying, ‘This man is like a buffalo, like a snake, \nlike a sparrow, like a donkey, like a dog, like a crow, or like an \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 407 - \nelephant’.  But in reality, such comparisons are not appropriate for \nhumans.  This is because all of those animals are in a completely \ndifferent group compared to humans.  Even between a human and a \nhuman, there is no exact similarity where a person can claim, ‘This \nperson is exactly like that person’.  If he were exactly like the other \nperson, then how could the original person be recognised? \n \n4.8 \n “Therefore, despite the fact that all humans belong to the same \ngroup, no two are exactly alike.  Just look at Bhago and Mulo – the \ntwo are said to be identical; but, if a person stays with them for a few \ndays, he can distinguish between them and say, ‘This is Bhago and this \nis Mulo’.  But, if there were no difference, how could they be \nrecognised?  So, if there is no great similarity between that which is \nmãyik and that which is not mãyik, what can possibly be compared to \nBhagvãn and the dhãm of Bhagvãn?  After all, all shãstras claim, \n‘Bhagvãn is beyond the reach of the indriyas and the antah-karans’. \n \n4.9 \n“When that Bhagvãn does not wish to give His darshan to beings, He \nstays in this way in His own Akshardhãm with a divya svarup, and as a \nresult He remains beyond reach.  That Bhagvãn is the lord of all lords, \nHe is surrounded by countless divya luxuries and countless divya \npãrshads, and He is the lord of countless millions of brahmãnds. \n \n4.10 “Take the example of a great world-emperor whose kingdom \nstretches from where the sun rises to where it sets.  This emperor, by \nthe strength of his own tap, has attained divine powers like those of \nthe devs, and is ruling over the loks of Svarg, Mrutyu-Lok, and Pãtãl – \njust like Arjun, who remained on the throne of Indra in Svarg-Lok for \nmany years with his own body, and Nahush Rãjã, who also became \nIndra.  The emperor is so powerful, that it is not possible to count the \nvillages in his kingdom, as they are innumerable.  The chiefs of these \nvillages also cannot be counted, as they are also innumerable.  \nFurthermore, the countless chiefs of those villages come to his darbãr \nto make requests.  The emperor’s money, property, pleasures, \npalaces, and wealth are also countless.   \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 408 - \n4.11 “Just like the emperor, Bhagvãn is the king of the kings of countless \nvillages (brahmãnds).  Moreover, the chiefs of those villages \n(brahmãnds) are Brahmã, Vishnu, and Shiv.  Just as in one village one \nchief is senior and the whole population of that village bows before \nhim and follows his ãgnã, and just as the chief in turn bows before \nthe king, similarly, in each brahmãnd, Brahmã, Vishnu, and Shiv are \nsenior, and the others in that brahmãnd, that are the devs, demons, \nhumans, rushis, and prajãpatis of that brahmãnd, worship them and \nfollow their ãgnã.  But, Brahmã, Vishnu, and Shiv in turn worship \nPurushottam Bhagvãn and follow His ãgnã.  Furthermore, all the \nBrahmãs, Vishnus, and Shivs of all the brahmãnds pray to Bhagvãn, \n‘Mahãrãj!  Please have compassion on us and visit our brahmãnd’ – just \nas the chief of a village requests the world-emperor, ‘Mahãrãj!  I am \npoor.  Please visit my house.  I shall serve you to the best of my ability’.  \nIn the same way, Brahmã, Vishnu, and Shiv pray to Bhagvãn, \n‘Mahãrãj!  Please have mercy upon us and grace us with your darshan; \nvisit our brahmãnd’.  Only then does Bhagvãn assume a body in that \nbrahmãnd. \n \n4.12 “Moreover, He assumes a body based on the task to be performed \nthere, and He also behaves accordingly.  If He assumes the body of a \ndev, then He behaves exactly like a dev.  If He assumes the body of an \nanimal, then He behaves exactly like an animal.  For example, when \nBhagvãn assumed the svarup of Varãh, He found the earth by \nsmelling it.  When He became Hayagriv, He started to neigh like a \nhorse.  When He assumed the bodies of water creatures, such as \nMatsya and Kurma, He moved only in water, but not on land.  When \nHe became the svarup of Nrusinh, He behaved exactly like a lion, not \nlike a human. \n \n4.13 “When that Bhagvãn assumes the svarup of a human being, He \nbehaves exactly like a human.  During Satya-Yug, the lifespan of \nhumans is one hundred thousand years, so Bhagvãn also lives for one \nhundred thousand years.  Also, just as people in Satya-Yug can \nindulge in any object their mind desires, Bhagvãn also indulges in \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 409 - \nobjects in the same way; He does not behave in any extraordinary \nway.  In Tretã-Yug, the lifespan of humans is ten thousand years.  So, \nwhen Bhagvãn is born in Tretã-Yug, He also lives for ten thousand \nyears.  In Dvãpar-Yug, the lifespan of humans is one thousand years, \nand humans possess the strength of ten thousand elephants.  So, \nBhagvãn also possesses the same strength and has the same lifespan.  \nFinally, when Bhagvãn is born in Kali-Yug, He assumes the lifespan \nand strength of humans according to the humans of Kali-Yug. \n \n4.14 “Just as a child is conceived, then develops in the womb, then is born, \nthen undergoes the phases of childhood, youth, and old age, and \neventually dies, Bhagvãn also undergoes the same process, exactly \nlike a human.  Also, just as humans possess svabhãvs –  such as kãm, \nkrodh, lobh, svãd, mãn, sneh, mad, matsar, irshyã, moh, ãshã, trushnã, \nhatred, attachment, infatuation, happiness, misery, fear, fearlessness, \nbravery, cowardice, hunger, thirst, sleep, prejudice, a feeling that this \nbelongs to others, a feeling that this belongs to me, tyãg, vairãgya – in \nthe same way, all of those svabhãvs are apparent in Bhagvãn when He \nassumes a human body.  All the shãstras have also described that \nhuman svarup of Bhagvãn along with His original, divya svarup.  A \nperson, who has developed a firm nishchay of both of those svarups \nthrough intense shravan and manan, never has any doubts; whereas \na person who lacks this type of understanding does have doubts \nabout Bhagvãn. \n \n4.15 “When that Bhagvãn – who possesses a divya svarup – assumes a \nhuman body, He behaves with svabhãvs similar to humans.  However, \nan intelligent person realises, ‘He possesses kãm, but it is not like that \nof other humans.  In fact, krodh, lobh, svãd, mãn, and other human \nsvabhãvs are also present in Bhagvãn, but they are certainly not like \nthose possessed by other humans’.  An intelligent person also realises \nthat there is something divya about that Bhagvãn, and with this \nunderstanding, he develops the belief of Him being Bhagvãn.  For \nexample, Shankar-Ãchãrya entered the body of a king in order to gain \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 410 - \nknowledge of certain affectionate details.  Therefore, at that time, his \nbodily gestures and his emotions were all affectionate like those of \nthe king.  However, the queen was intelligent and realised, ‘My \nhusband did not possess such powers; therefore, some other jeev has \nentered his body’.  In the same way, divya qualities are apparent in \nBhagvãn in human svarup.  As a result, a person develops the \nnishchay in Him being Bhagvãn. \n \n4.16 “Then you may say, ‘If someone develops the nishchay in Bhagvãn on \nnoticing something divya, then if He were to display divya qualities, \nmany people would develop the same belief’.  However, the fact of the \nmatter is as follows:  All the shãstras refer to the sun by saying, ‘It is \nBhagvãn’.  Moreover, that sun is visible to everyone, and people do its \ndarshan daily.  Despite this, no person has ever been convinced of his \nor her own kalyãn as a result of its darshan, and they do not believe, ‘I \nhave attained kalyãn’.  On the other hand, after having the darshan of \nRãm, Krishna, and the other avatãrs in human svarup, and of Nãrad, \nShukji, and other sãdhus, people do attain the belief that my kalyãn is \ncertainly guaranteed, and I am fulfilled.  Even though there is no \ndivine light in that Bhagvãn and those sãdhus, and a person can only \nhave their darshan after lighting an oil lamp, he still becomes \nconvinced of his own kalyãn. \n \n4.17 “Consider another example:  Fire is also a visible svarup of Bhagvãn, \nas Bhagvãn has said: \n \n \naham vaishvãnaro bhootvã prãninãm deha-mãshritaha \nprãnãpãna-samãyuktaha pachãmyanam chaturvirdham \nRemaining in the bodies of all being as Vaishvanar (the fire of digestion), I \ndigest the four types of food (chewable, drinkable, lickable, and suckable) with \nthe help of prãn vãyu (inhaled air) and apãn vãyu (air that pushes food \ndownwards). \n \n4.18 “The darshan of that fire is available to all, but that does not grant \npeople belief of their own kalyãn, whereas with the darshan of \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 411 - \nBhagvãn and His sãdhu, they do gain belief of their own kalyãn.  The \nreason for this is that there is a difference between humans, and the \nsun and fire; as a result, a person is not convinced of his kalyãn upon \nhaving the darshan of the sun or fire.  Instead, if someone touches \nfire, he will be burnt.  Furthermore, when Kuntãji called upon Surya \nusing the mantra given by Durvãsã, Surya came to Kuntãji in a human \nsvarup just like Kuntãji’s own svarup.  As a result, she was able to \nenjoy his intimacy, and therefore conceived Karna.  In actuality, Surya \nis extremely luminous; and if he had come with all of his light, Kuntãji \nwould have been burnt to death, and she would not have been able to \nenjoy his intimacy.  Also, when Surya used to come to Satrãjit Yãdav, \nhe came as a human.  However, when he came to Kuntãji and came to \nSatrãjit, did he leave his place in the sky?  He remained in the sky; but \nassuming another svarup, that very same Surya came to Kuntãji and \nSatrãjit.  Moreover, there was just as much luminosity in that svarup \nas there is in the sun, but he suppressed that luminosity and came as \na human. \n \n4.19 “In the same way, if Bhagvãn were to give darshan to beings with all \nof His divya qualities, then humans would not find it suitable, and \nthey would wonder, ‘Is this a ghost, or what?’  Therefore, Bhagvãn \nsuppresses His own divya powers and gives darshan exactly like a \nhuman.  But, at the same time, He still remains present in His own \ndhãm.  Only when Bhagvãn comes as a human are people able to do \nHis darshan, touch Him, and offer the nine types of bhakti. \n \n4.20 “If Bhagvãn does not become like a human and instead behaves with \ncomplete divya qualities, then people would not be able to develop \nlove or feelings of friendship for Him.  This is because a human \ndevelops love and friendship for another human, and animals \ndevelop mutual love and friendship for other animals; but humans \nand animals do not develop the same love and friendship for each \nother.  Therefore, those belonging to the same group develop love \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 412 - \ntowards each other, but not towards those belonging to a different \ngroup. \n \n4.21 “Similarly, Bhagvãn suppresses His divya qualities and becomes \nexactly like a human so that His bhaktas can develop love for Him.  He \ndoes not exhibit His divya qualities.  Exhibiting His divya qualities \nwould place Him in a different group, and as a result, bhaktas would \nnot be able to develop love and friendship towards Him.  It is for this \nreason that when Bhagvãn appears in human svarup, He remains \nextremely cautious to ensure that His divya qualities remain hidden.  \nHowever, if He were to become a little impatient in some task, His \ndivya qualities would become apparent.  Occasionally, by His own \nwish, He may reveal His divya qualities to some bhakta.  For example, \nas Shree Krishna Bhagvãn became impatient to kill Bhishma, He \nforgot his human-like nature and reverted to His divya powers.  As a \nresult, the earth was incapable of bearing the burden.  When He \nrevealed His divya qualities to Arjun, it was revealed as a result of His \nown wish.  However, Arjun did not experience bliss due to that divya \nqualities, and he become very uneasy.  Then, when Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn gave darshan to Arjun in His human svarup, Arjun \nexperienced bliss and said: \n \ndrusht-vedam mãnusham rupam tava saumyam janãrdana \nidaneem-asmi samvruttaha sachetãha prakrutim gataha \nVanquisher of the evil (Krishna)!  Having seen your gentle human svarup, I am \nnow calm and have been restored to my original nature. \n \n4.22 “Therefore, a person only finds it suitable when Bhagvãn behaves \nlike a human; otherwise he would not.  Yet, when Bhagvãn behaves \nas a human, a person who does not have this understanding would \nfind it difficult to accept His human-like nature.  Moreover, if \nBhagvãn were to behave with only divya qualities, a person would be \nunable to understand all that is beyond the reach of the mind and \nspeech.  For this reason, the shãstras have described Bhagvãn in both \nways.  A person who has fully realised Him in this way would not \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 413 - \ndevelop any doubts; but, doubts would certainly arise in a person \nwho does not understand in this way. \n \n4.23 “Someone may claim, ‘I have realised Bhagvãn, and I have nishchay in \nBhagvãn’.  But, if he has not understood this talk, then his nishchay is \nstill imperfect.  For example, a person may have learnt a shlok or a \nkirtan.  If he were asked, ‘Have you learnt this shlok or kirtan?’ he \nwould reply that he has, and he would also be able to recite it.  But, if \nhe were to forget that shlok or kirtan after a few days, then it can be \nsaid that when he originally learnt the shlok, he had not learnt it \nproperly.  This is because that shlok or kirtan was not fully imprinted \nin his jeev through intense practice, and through shravan and manan.  \nHowever, if something is learnt in childhood thoroughly, then it can \nbe recalled when required, even during youth or old age.  In the same \nway, when that person attempted to develop the nishchay in \nBhagvãn, some deficiencies remained.  If no deficiencies had \nremained, and if he had done shravan, manan, and intense repetition \nin his jeev, then he would never have had any doubts at all.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Panchãlã || 4 || 130 || \n \n \nPanchãlã – 5 \nPride And Humility \n \n5.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Fãgan vad 8 [27th March, 1821], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had been placed on \na platform in Jhinã-Bhãi’s darbãr in Panchãlã.  He was wearing a \nwhite khes and a warm, red dagli.  He had also tied a white feto \naround His head.  In addition to this, He had covered Himself with a \nwhite chãdar.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, has gathered before Him. \n \n5.2 \nThen, Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi asked a question:  “When is pride \nappropriate, and when is it not appropriate?  When is humbleness \nappropriate, and when is it not appropriate?” \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 414 - \n5.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “It is appropriate to have pride before a \nperson who spites satsang, or speaks offensively of Bhagvãn or His \ngreat sant.  If someone does speak offensively, a person should \nretaliate with words as sharp as an arrow; but in no way should he \nbecome humble before a vimukh.  In such a situation, that is \nappropriate.  On the other hand, it is not appropriate to have pride \nbefore Bhagvãn or His sant.  Before them, putting pride aside, \nbehaving as a dãs of a dãs, and becoming humble, is the only \nappropriate behaviour.” \n \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Panchãlã || 5 || 131 || \n \n \nPanchãlã – 6 \nThose With Firm Upãsanã Attain Kalyãn \n \n6.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Fãgan vad 9 [28th March, \n1821], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had \nbeen placed on a platform of Jhinã-Bhãi’s darbãr in Panchãlã.  He was \nwearing a warm, red dagli along with a white angarkhu.  He had also \ntied a white feto around His head.  In addition to this, He was wearing \na white khes and had covered Himself with a thin, white cloth.  A \nsabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \n6.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “I thought for quite some time, and \nhaving mentally skimmed through all the shãstras, it has become \napparent that there has not been any avatãr as powerful as Shree \nKrishna.  This is because Shree Krishna has exhibited the \ncharacteristics of all of His other countless svarups within Himself. \n \n6.3 \n“Firstly, after Devki gave birth to Him, He gave darshan in a four-\narmed svarup holding a shankh, a chakra, a gadã, and a padma, \nthereby revealing in Himself the characteristics of the husband of \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 415 - \nLakshmi, Bhagvãn.  To His mother Yashodã, He showed the Vishvarup \nform in His own mouth, which revealed the characteristics of \nAniruddha in Himself through His thousand-headed svarup.  He gave \ndarshan to Akrur in the river Yamunã, thereby revealing the \ncharacteristics of Shesh-Shãyi.  He showed the Vishvarup form to \nArjun on the battlefield: \n \npashya me pãrth rupãni shata-shotha sahastra-shaha \nO Son of Pruthã (Arjun).  Behold my hundreds and thousands of divine \nsvarups. \n \n“Shree Krishna showed countless brahmãnds and revealed the \ncharacteristics of Purushottam.  \n \n6.4 \n“Moreover, Shree Krishna has said: \n \nyasmãt-ksharama-teeto-hama-ksharãd-api chottamaha \natosmi loke vede cha prathitaha Purushottamaha \nI am greater than all that is perishable, and I am greater than even the \nimperishable. Therefore, I am known in the Smrutis and Veds as \n‘Purushottam’. \n \n“In this way, He revealed Himself as Purushottam.  Also, He was the \nShree Krishna who resides in Golok with Rãdhikã. \n \n6.5 \n“When Shree Krishna went to retrieve the brãhman’s son, He gave \ndarshan to Arjun as Bhumã-Purush.  It was Vãsudev, who resides in \nShvet-Dvip who Himself assumed that avatãr.  Moreover, throughout \nthe Mahãbhãrat and the Shreemad Bhãgvat, Nãr-Nãrãyan has been \nreferred to as that Shree Krishna Himself.  Therefore, the murtis, \nstrength, and divya powers of that same Bhagvãn, which reside in \nthat avatãr of Shree Krishna in various ways, are complete.  \nTherefore, that avatãr was very great.  After all, other svarups \npossessed a few divya powers, whereas Shree Krishna was filled with \nall divya powers.  Therefore, there is no avatãr like the avatãr of \nKrishna; that avatãr reigns as sarvopari.  Only some powers have \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 416 - \nbeen revealed through the other avatãrs.  However, this avatãr has \nrevealed all divya powers and strengths.  Therefore, this avatãr is the \ngreatest of all. \n \n6.6 \n“If a person has a firm belief of the pratyaksha Shree Krishna in this \nway, and if that belief never changes in any way, then even if he \nhappens to disobey an ãgnã due to the influence of kusang, he would \nnot fall from the path of kalyãn; he would certainly attain kalyãn.  \nTherefore, if all of you paramhans and haribhaktas also develop such \nfirmness of the upãsanã of Bhagvãn in this way, then even if you \nhappen to slightly disobey an ãgnã, you will still ultimately attain \nkalyãn.” \n \n6.7 \nHearing this talk, all the sãdhus and haribhaktas realised Shreeji \nMahãrãj as the cause of all, which strengthened their upãsanã. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Panchãlã || 6 || 132 || \n \n \nPanchãlã – 7 \nThe ‘Mãyã’ Of A Magician \n \n \n \n7.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, about two-and-a-half hours after sunrise on \nFãgan vad 11 [29th March, 1821], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a \ndecorated bedstead that had been placed on a platform in Jhinã-\nBhãi’s darbãr in Panchãlã.  He was wearing a warm, red dagli and a \nwhite khes.  He had also tied a white feto around His head.  In \naddition to this, He had covered Himself with a white pachhedi.  A \nsabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \n7.2 \nIn the sabhã, Shreeji Mahãrãj had Nityãnand Swãmi read a passage \nfrom the first skandh of the Shreemad Bhãgvat.  The first shlok he \nread was: \n \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 417 - \njanmãdyasya yatah-nvayad-itaratash-chãrtheshvabhignaha svarãt \ntene brahma  hrudã ya ãdikavaye muhyanti yat-soorayaha \ntejo-vãri-mrudãm yathã vinimayo yatra trisargo mrushã \ndhãmnã svena sadã nirasta-kuhakam satyam param dheemahi \n \n7.3 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj Himself began to explain the meaning of the \nthird line of that shlok: “A person should realise that the entities \nevolved out of the three gun of Mãyã, which are the five bhuts, the \nindriyas, the antah-karans, and their presiding devs, are never \npresent in Bhagvãn at any time – past, present, or future.  Also, a \nperson should interpret the last line as the shlok, as follows:  \nBhagvãn, via His own svarup (dhãm), destroyed the deception (the \nproducts of mãyã).  This is the supremely satya svarup of Bhagvãn.  \nMoreover, just as the svarup of Bhagvãn in Akshardhãm is \nmagnificent with countless divine powers and divine light at the end \nof ãtyantik-pralay, a person should realise exactly the same regarding \npratyaksha Bhagvãn in human svarup.  A person who realises this is \nsaid to have known Bhagvãn perfectly. \n \n7.4 \n“However, when a foolish person looks at pratyaksha Bhagvãn with a \nmãyik vision, he sees a human like himself.  Also, just as he himself is \nborn, becomes a child, becomes a youth, becomes old and dies, in the \nsame way, he believes Bhagvãn to undergo the same process.  But, \nwhen he worships Bhagvãn with the sincerity, having faith in the \nwords of the ekãntik sant of Bhagvãn, his mãyik vision disappears.  \nThen, a person realises that same svarup of Bhagvãn as being the \nsupreme chaitanya, which is sachidãnand.  The Shreemad Bhãgvat \nalso mentions: \n \nsa veda dhãtuha padaveem parasya duranta-veeryasya rathãnga-panehe \nyo-mãyayã santa-tayãnu-vruttya bhajeta tat-pãda-saroja-gandhama \nHe who, having become free from mãyã, serves the holy feet of Bhagvãn, will \nconstantly follow His wishes, and attain the state of Bhagvãn – who holds a \nchakra in His hand, has infinite powers, and is the supporter of the universe. \n \n7.5 \n“The phases of childhood, youth, and old age apparent in Bhagvãn, as \nwell as His birth and death, are all seen due to His extraordinary \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 418 - \npowers of creating an illusion.  In reality, Bhagvãn remains absolutely \nunchanged.  For example, a skilled magician arms himself with \nweapons and ascends to the sky to fight against the warriors of the \ndemons – the enemies of Indra.  Then, having been cut to pieces, he \nfalls to the ground.  Then, the magician’s wife gathers those pieces \ntogether and burns herself on his funeral pyre.  After a short while, \nthe magician appears out of the sky, armed with weapons, exactly as \nhe appeared before.  He then asks the king for a reward and requests, \n‘Please return my wife’.  Having seen such an astonishing \nperformance, if a person is unable to comprehend the ‘mãyã’ of even \na magician, how then can the extraordinary powers of Bhagvãn \npossibly be comprehended?  A person who does comprehend that \n‘mãyã’ of the magician, realises:  ‘That magician has not died, nor has \nhe been burnt.  In reality, he is exactly the same as he was before’.  In a \nsimilar way, a person who is said to have realised the svarup of \nBhagvãn perfectly, understands Bhagvãn to be eternal and \nimperishable, and absolutely unchanging.  For example, when Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn left His body, Rukmani and the other wives of \nBhagvãn took His body and burnt themselves along with Him.  At that \ntime, the ignorant people thought, ‘Now He is dead’.  On the other \nhand, those who possessed gnãn, thought, ‘He has disappeared from \nhere and has gone elsewhere’.  They understood Bhagvãn as being \neternal.  As a result, Shree Krishna Himself has said: \n \navajananti mãm moodha mãnusheem tanum-ãshritam \nparam bhãvam-ajãnanto mama bhoota-maheshvaram \nFools mock me as having a human svarup, but they do not realise my divya \nsvarup as the great lord of all beings. \n \n7.6 \n“So, if a fool understands Bhagvãn as being sãkãr, then he \nunderstands Him as being merely like a human; or he understands \nBhagvãn as being nirãkãr so that He is not considered mãyik like \nother mãyik svarups.  In this way, a fool misunderstands on both \naccounts. \n \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 419 - \n7.7 \n“But, if Bhagvãn did not have a svarup, then what about the fact that \nShrutis have said that during ãtyantik-pralay, ‘sa ikshata’, meaning, \n‘That Bhagvãn saw…’.  If Bhagvãn ‘saw’, then He had to have a svarup, \npossessing eyes, ears and other organs.  Moreover, it is said:   \n \npurushenãtam-bhootena veeryamã-dhatta veeryavãnã \nPurushottam became the svarup of Purush and impregnated Mãyã.  \n \n“Therefore, Bhagvãn has always had a svarup. \n \n7.8 \n“Moreover, when that Purushottam Nãrãyan takes the svarup of \nPurush for some task, that Purush is hidden by the divine light of \nPurushottam, and only Purushottam remains.  In the same way, when \nPurushottam takes the form of Mãyã, that Mãyã is also hidden by the \ndivine light of Purushottam, and only Bhagvãn remains in that svarup.  \nThen, Bhagvãn takes the svarup of maha-tattva, then the svarups of \nothers evolved from maha-tattva, then the svarup of Virãt, then the \nsvarup of Brahmã and others created from that Virãt-Purush, and \nthen the svarup of Nãrad and the Sanakãdik.  In this way, in \nwhomever that Purushottam Bhagvãn ‘enters’ for the purpose of \nfulfilling many types of tasks, He hides that entity by His own divine \nlight, and He Himself reigns supreme through that entity.  Moreover, \nin whomever He resides, He suppresses their own light and displays \nHis own divine light – just as when fire enters iron, it suppresses the \nquality of coldness and the black colour of that iron, and exhibits its \nown quality.   \n \n7.9 \n“Also, when the sun rises, the light from all the stars and the moon, \nmerges into its own light, and only the sun’s light remains.  In the \nsame way, Bhagvãn overpowers the light of whoever He ‘enters’ and \nexhibits His own divine light to a greater degree.  Then, after \ncompleting that task for which He had ‘entered’ that entity, He \nseparates from the entity; and the entity remains as it was before.  \nTherefore, the additional powers that the entity appeared to have \nshould be known to actually be the power of Purushottam Bhagvãn. \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 420 - \n7.10 “In this way, the pratyaksha Purushottam Nãrãyan is the cause of all; \nHe is forever divya and is sãkãr.  A person should not perceive any \ntype of imperfections in that murti – it is like a murti made of sãkar.  \nAlso, he should perform dhyãn, bhajan, and offer bhakti only to the \nmurti that he has seen.  Furthermore, whichever human traits seem \napparent in that Bhagvãn should be understood to be like the ‘mãyã’ \nof a magician.  A person who has such an understanding does not \ndevelop delusion for that Bhagvãn in any way. \n \n7.11 “These talks can be understood by a person with the following firm \nbelief:  ‘Even at the time of ãtyantik-pralay, Bhagvãn and His bhaktas \nremain in Akshardhãm, where the bhaktas enjoy divya bliss, having \nattained a divya murti.  Moreover, the murti of that Bhagvãn and the \nsvarups of the bhaktas of Bhagvãn possess divine light that is \nequivalent to the light of countless suns and moons’.  Only a person \nwith such firm understanding is able to understand these talks. \n \n7.12 “Also, that Bhagvãn – who has a luminous and divya murti – becomes \nlike a human out of compassion, to give kalyãn to the jeevs and to \nallow those jeevs to offer the nine types of bhakti to Him; and  He \nalways does so with all of His strength, divine powers, and pãrshads.  \nEven then, those who realise this complex truth understand the \nhuman svarup of Bhagvãn on this earth as being exactly the same as \nthe svarup of Bhagvãn residing in Akshardhãm – they do not feel that \nthere is even a slight difference between that svarup and this svarup.  \nA person who has known Bhagvãn in this way can be said to have \nknown Bhagvãn perfectly.  For him, mãyã can be said to have been \neradicated.  A person who realises this is called a bhakta with gnãn \nand an ekãntik bhakta.  Moreover, if by chance a person possessing \nsuch firm upãsanã of pratyaksha Bhagvãn were to behave \ninappropriately due to the influence of kusang or due to the influence \nof his own prãrabdha karmas, even then he would attain kalyãn.  On \nthe other hand, a person who has doubts in realising Bhagvãn in this \nway, even if he is a strict urdhvaretã naishtik brahm-chãri and a great \ntyãgi, attaining kalyãn would still be extremely difficult for him. \nPANCHÃLÃ \n- 421 - \n7.13 “If a person has, from the beginning, developed a firm belief that \nBhagvãn is sãkãr even at the end of ãtyantik-pralay, and if he were to \nlisten to shãstras describing Bhagvãn as being merely full of divine \nlight and nirãkãr, or if he were to hear such talks from someone, even \nthen he would not have doubts.  This is because he has realised, \n‘Bhagvãn is eternally sãkãr and is never nirãkãr.  Furthermore, that \nvery Bhagvãn assumes different murtis, such as Rãm and Krishna’.  A \nperson with such firm understanding should be known to have \nperfect nishchay.” \n \n7.14 In this way, for the purpose of enlightening His bhaktas, Shreeji \nMahãrãj talked about the unparalleled nishchay of His own svarup.  \nOn hearing this, all the paramhans and bhaktas strengthened their \nnishchay in Shreeji Mahãrãj’s svarup as described. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Panchãlã || 7 || 133 || \n \n \n|| End of Shree Panchãlã Prakaran ||\nGADHADÃ II \n- 422 - \n|| SHREE SWÃMINÃRAYAN VIJAYTETRÃM || \n \nVACHANÃMRUT \nShree Gadhadã Madhya Prakaran \n \nGadhadã II – 1 \nThe Elimination Of Moh \n \n1.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Jyeshth sud Punam [15th June 1821], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda \noutside the west-facing rooms in front of the mandir of Shree \nVãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was \nwearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chãdar.  \nHe had also tied a white pãgh around His head, and was wearing a \ngarland of white flowers.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him.  Some of the \nparamhans were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a jhãnjh \nand mrudang. \n \n1.2 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then said to the paramhans who were singing \nkirtans, “Please stop singing for the time being, and conduct a \nquestion-answer discussion.” \n \n1.3 \nThen, Muktãnand Swãmi bowed to Shreeji Mahãrãj with folded hands \nand asked, “Mahãrãj, what is that nature of moh?  Also, how can moh \nbe eliminated?” \n \n1.4 \nAfter thinking for a short while, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “It seems \nthat a feeling of illusion which often appears in the mind is the very \nnature of moh.  When moh intensifies in a person’s heart, the illusion \nin his mind also intensifies.  He then loses all sense of judgment of \nwhat should be done and what should not be done. \n \n1.5 \n“In fact, just today, I was thinking about the reason behind the \ndevelopment of moh.  Last night, I awoke in the middle of the night \nGADHADÃ II \n- 423 - \nand slept facing north.  Upon seeing the Dhruv Star, the following \nthought arose:  ‘This is the northern Dhruv, but the shãstras also \nmention a southern Dhruv.  Where could that be?’  Then, I looked for \nthe southern Dhruv and I saw it as well.  Just as there is a pulley for \ndrawing water from a well, I saw a similar large pulley between the \ntwo Dhruv stars.  The tips of the two supports of the wheel were \ntouching the Dhruv stars, just as wooden pillars are held up by iron \nrods hammered between them.  Also, just as a rope is wound around \na rope-wheel which is studded with brass ornaments, similarly, I saw \nthe positions of all the stars, the devs, and the nine planets, arranged \naround that rope-wheel.  I also saw the sun and moon rise and set \nfrom the same direction.  Then, looking within, I saw that all things \nthat are in the brahmãnd are also all in the body.  I saw the \nkshetragna that resides in the body.  I also saw Purushottam Bhagvãn, \nwho resides within that kshetragna.  On seeing that Bhagvãn, my \nvrutti became so deeply engrossed in His svarup, that returning out of \nsamãdhi seemed impossible.  But, a bhakta then came near and \nprayed to me.  It was only out of compassion that I was able to return \ninto this body. \n \n1.6 \n“Then, the following thought arose in my mind:  ‘I was able to return \nfrom samãdhi due to compassion, but what could be the reason for \nothers coming out of samãdhi?’  It seemed to me that they come out of \nsamãdhi because there is still an attachment for some vishays. \n \n1.7 \n“Therefore, the panch-vishays are the cause of moh.  Moreover, there \nare three levels of those vishays – uttam, madhyam, and kanishth.  Of \nthese, if a person who has obtained uttam vishays encounters \nsomeone who obstructs him from them, then that person becomes \nangry with him.  From that anger, moh develops. \n \n1.8 \n“Generally, the ears have a constant relationship with sounds, and \nthe skin has a constant relationship with touch.  In this way, the five \ngnãn-indriyas are related to the vishays.  Therefore, if a person who \nGADHADÃ II \n- 424 - \nhas casually seen an object wishes to break his vrutti from that object \nand keep it focused on the svarup of Bhagvãn instead, then no effort \nis required; his vrutti would become detached quite easily from the \nvishays and remain on the svarup of Bhagvãn.  On the other hand, if a \nperson has seen an extremely charming object, such as a woman, and \nhis vrutti has become fixed on that, then even if he attempts to keep \nthis vrutti on Bhagvãn’s svarup, it will not stay there; and nor will his \nchitt remain steady.  Therefore, as long as the chitt is attracted by \ncharming vishays, moh cannot be eradicated.  Moreover, if a sant, or \nhis guru, or his ishta-dev (Bhagvãn) criticises a vishay which has \nattracted his chitt, he would become upset with them and even insult \nthem; he would not be able to accept their words.  Such an \nexperience in a person’s heart should be known as moh.  In addition, \nBhagvãn has said in the Geetã: \n \ndhyãyato vishayan-punsaha sanga-steshu-pajãyate \nsangat-sanjãyate kãmaha kãmãt-krodho-bhijãyate \nkrodhãd-bhavati sammohaha sammohãt-smruti-vibhramaha \nsmruti-bhranshãd-buddhi-nãsho bhudhi-nashãt-pranashyati \nA person thinking about the sense objects develops attachment toward them. \nFrom the attachment, desires develop; from the desires, anger develops; from \nanger, delusion develops; from delusion, confusion of the mind develops; from \nconfusion of the mind, loss of buddhi develops; and as a result of the loss of \nbuddhi, he perishes. \n \n \n“These words spoken by Shree Krishna Bhagvãn are universal \nprinciples.  When the chitt is attracted to vishays, no matter how \nintelligent a person may be, his buddhi becomes unstable and he \nbecomes like an animal.  Therefore, moh is generated due to \nattachment to the vishays. \n \n1.9 \n“Now, if a person who wishes to detach his chitt from those vishays, \nhe should firstly strengthen his knowledge of the ãtmã – ‘I am the \nãtmã, not this body’.  Secondly, he should understand the nature of \nhow the universe is created, sustained, and destroyed.  Thirdly, he \nshould thoroughly understand the greatness of Bhagvãn.  He should \nGADHADÃ II \n- 425 - \nthink, ‘The panch-vishays have been created by Bhagvãn; therefore, \nthere must be much more bliss in Bhagvãn than there is in them.  How \nis that?  Well, sounds contain only pleasures related to sounds; the \npleasures of the other four types of vishays cannot be found in sounds’.  \nIn the same way, only the pleasures of touch and no other vishays can \nbe found in touch.  Similarly, only the pleasures of sight exist in \nsights.  The same applies for tastes and smells in that only their own \npleasures exist, but the pleasures of all the panch-vishays cannot be \nexperienced in just one vishay. \n \n1.10 “On the other hand, in Bhagvãn’s svarup, all pleasures exist at the \nsame time.  Therefore, even if a bhakta only has darshan, he still feels \ntotally satisfied.  Similarly, touch and other types of contact with \nBhagvãn also make His bhaktas feel totally fulfilled.  Also, the worldly \npleasures related to vishays are all perishable, whereas the bliss \nrelated to Bhagvãn is everlasting.  Such thoughts of the greatness of \nBhagvãn should be strengthened.  So, attachment to the vishays is \neradicated through these three types of thoughts. \n \n1.11 “When attachment to the vishays is eradicated, a person no longer \nmakes distinctions between pleasant and unpleasant vishays – an \nugly woman appears the same as a beautiful woman.  In the same \nway, he sees everything – animals, birds, wood, dung, stones, and \ngold – to be the same; he is not infatuated on seeing a pleasant object.  \nThis is how he views the panch-vishays; and no distinctions between \npleasantness and unpleasantness remain in his mind.  A person who \nbehaves like this is known to be free of moh.  Shree Krishna Bhagvãn \nhas also mentioned this in the Geetã: \n \nsama-loshtãshma-kãnchanaha \nHe who regards a lump of earth, a stone, and gold as equal, is said to be \ngunãtit. \n \n1.12 “A person with such characteristics has realised Bhagvãn perfectly; \nand only he can be called an ekãntik bhakta.  He should be known to \nGADHADÃ II \n- 426 - \nhave qualities like that of a pati-vratã who abides by the vow of \nfidelity, and only he should be known to possess gnãn.  Also, Bhagvãn \nbecomes pleased upon him.  Such a bhakta is extremely dear to \nBhagvãn; that is why Bhagvãn has said in the Geetã: \n \npriyo hi gnãnino-tyartha-maham sa cha mama priyaha \nI am very dear to a person with gnãn, and he is dear to me. \n \n1.13 “So, only such bhaktas of Bhagvãn, who have qualities like that of a \npati-vratã, are extremely dear to Bhagvãn.  Moreover, it is not as if \nsuch qualities are only acquired by a person who is clever; it is \nacquired by all those who have an intense desire for them – just like \nin the world, naïve wives may be faithful, while shrewd wives may be \nunfaithful.  Therefore, it does not matter whether a person is shrewd \nor naïve; instead, it is those who have an intense desire for kalyãn \nthat keep the qualities of a pati-vratã and offer bhakti to Bhagvãn. \n \n1.14 “The state in which a person views pleasant and unpleasant vishays \nas equal and becomes free of moh, cannot be attained in just one day.  \nSuch an achievement cannot be accomplished so hastily; only a \nperson who attempts to do so gradually and earnestly accomplishes \nit.  Take the example of a stone placed on the edge of a water-well.  \nDue to the constant drawing of water with a rope, after a long period \nof time that rope causes a groove to form in the stone, despite the \nrope being soft.  Even if an iron chain were to be used to draw the \nwater, such a groove would still not form immediately.  Therefore, \nthose who wish to strive for kalyãn should eradicate attachment to \nthe vishays, and they should not become frustrated or upset.  This is \nalso mentioned in the Geetã: \n \nanek-janma-sansiddh-stato yãti parãm gatim \nA yogi who has become siddh after many lives, attains Akshardhãm. \n \n1.15 “Therefore, a person should think, ‘I will eradicate as much \nattachment to the vishays as is possible in this life, and if in the process, \nGADHADÃ II \n- 427 - \nsome attachment still remains, then it can be eradicated in a future life.  \nMoreover, since I am a bhakta of Bhagvãn, I do not desire to enter the \ncycle of births and deaths’.  In this way, a bhakta should remain \ncourageous and continue to gradually uproot moh. \n \n1.16 “As long as pleasant and unpleasant vishays do not appear to be \nequal, a bhakta of Bhagvãn is said to be in sãdhan-dashã.  When they \ndo appear to be equal, that bhakta should be known to have attained \nsiddh-dashã.  When a person abandons his attachment to vishays and \nattains siddh-dashã, he should be known to have become fulfilled.  \nThis is the very essence of all the shãstras.  Furthermore, this talk \nwhich I have delivered before you is the fundamental principle of all \nthe shãstras.  Therefore, all bhaktas should firmly remember it in \ntheir lives.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 1 || 134 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 2 \nOvercoming The Panch-Vishays \n \n2.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1877, on Shrãvan sud 3 [1st August 1821], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a silken, square cushion in \nfront of the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A \nsabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him.  Some of the munis were singing kirtans to the \naccompaniment of a jhãnjh and mrudang. \n \n2.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please stop singing as I wish to speak to \nyou.”  Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, “A person who wishes to attain \nultimate kalyãn and hopes to become a sãdhu like Nãrad and the \nSanakãdik, should think, ‘The jeev resides in the body; and the indriyas \nand antah-karans have attached themselves to that jeev’.  They have \nGADHADÃ II \n- 428 - \nalso attached themselves externally to the panch-vishays.  However, \ndue to ignorance, the jeev believes those indriyas, and the antah-\nkarans to be its own form, whereas in actual fact, it is distinct from \nthem.  The vishays are also distinct from the antah-karans, but \nbecause of constant association with them, they appear to have \nbecome one with the antah-karans. \n \n2.3 \n“In fact, the desire to indulge in the vishays actually arises because of \nthe indriyas, not because of the antah-karans.  For example, extreme \nheat or cold first comes into contact with the outer indriyas, and then \nenters the body via those indriyas.  In other words, it is not generated \nfrom within; it is generated outside and then enters within.  In the \nsame way, desires for the panch-vishays are not initially generated in \nthe antah-karans; the indriyas first come into contact with the vishays \nexternally, and then those vishays enter the antah-karans.  To give \nanother example, when an ulcer develops externally on the skin, it \ncan be soothed only by applying medication externally, not by merely \nhearing talks.  Also, hunger and thirst can only be relieved by eating \nand drinking, but not by merely talking about food and water.  In the \nsame way, the disease (panch-vishays) can only be cured when \nmedication is applied externally. \n \n2.4 \n“The method of applying that medication is as follows:  When a \nperson’s skin touches a vishay, like women and other objects, that \nobject ‘enters’ the antah-karans via the skin.  Then, via the antah-\nkarans, it ‘enters’ the jeev.  The vishay was not initially generated \nfrom within the jeev or from the antah-karans.  In fact, all vishays \nwhich currently spring forth from the antah-karans have definitely \n‘entered’ from outside through the indriyas – in a previous life.  \nTherefore, the medicine for eradicating attachment to the vishays is \nas follows:  A person should refrain from touching objects like \nwomen and other tempting objects via the skin; he should not look at \ntheir beauty via the eyes, nor talk about them using the tongue; he \nshould not listen to them or about them via the ears; he should not \nGADHADÃ II \n- 429 - \nsmell their fragrance through the nose.  Through the five indriyas, if a \nperson firmly abstains from the vishays in this way, then the ‘flow’ of \nthe vishays cannot enter within from outside.  For example, a water-\nwell can only be cleaned when the small streamlets of water that flow \ninto the well are clogged from their entrance with cloth rags.  In the \nsame way, by keeping control over the external indriyas, the external \nvishays cannot enter the antah-karans. \n \n2.5 \n“A stomach illness can only be cured when medicine enters the \nstomach.  In the same way, the vishays that have already accumulated \nin the antah-karans by the way of the indriyas should be eradicated \nby thinking of his own self as the ãtmã.  He should think, ‘I am the \nãtmã.  The indriyas and the antah-karans have absolutely no \nrelationship with me’.  With such firm thinking, by seeing Bhagvãn’s \nmurti in that chaitanya (jeev), and through the bliss of the ãtmã, he \nshould remain fulfilled.  Take the example of a water-well that is \ncompletely full of water.  The water in the well will prevent the flow \nof new water from entering the well.  However, if the well is emptied \nby drawing water from it, then new water from outside will enter it.  \nSimilarly, through the bliss of the ãtmã, a person should remain \nfulfilled within.  Externally, he should obstruct the ‘inflow’ of the \nvishays through the indriyas.  This is the only definite method for \novercoming vicious natures, such as kãm and krodh; they cannot be \novercome by upvãs alone.  So please remember this thought firmly in \nyour lives.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 2 || 135 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 3 \nThe Rasik Path \nThe Knowledge Of The Ãtmã \n \n3.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1878, on Shrãvan sud 4 [2nd August 1821], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a square cushion in front \nGADHADÃ II \n- 430 - \nof the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of \nparamhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him.  Some of the paramhans were singing kirtans to the \naccompaniment of a jhãnjh and mrudang. \n \n3.2 \nThen, with a gesture of His eyes, Shreeji Mahãrãj silenced the \naudience and said, “Those of you who are senior paramhans, please \ncome to the front as I wish to speak to you.” \n \n3.3 \nSo saying, Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, “For those who worship \nBhagvãn, there are two paths that lead to greatness, and there are \nalso two paths that lead to downfall, all of which I shall now explain.  \nOne path is to offer bhakti to Bhagvãn via the rasik path, and the \nother path is knowledge of the ãtmã.  Both can lead to greatness, but \nboth can also lead to downfall.  Of these, thousands have fallen from \nthe rasik path, with only a few attaining Bhagvãn.  Even the great \nãchãryas have encouraged the offering of bhakti via the rasik path.  \nHowever, many have been ruined by it, and only a few have \nbenefited. \n \n3.4 \n“The reason for this is that when Bhagvãn is described in a rasik way, \nRãdhikãji and Lakshmiji, along with their companions, are also \ndescribed together with Bhagvãn.  When women are described, \nobviously their physical features are also described.  Then, how can \nthe mind of the person who is describing them possibly remain \nundisturbed?  In fact, the nature of the indriyas is such that they only \ndevelop affection for those vishays that are seductive.  No woman in \nall the loks possesses beauty that matches the beauty of Rãdhikãji or \nLakshmiji, nor is there anyone who has such a sweet voice as theirs; \neven the fragrance radiating from their bodies is unrivalled.  \nTherefore, upon seeing or hearing about such beauty, how can a \nperson not become infatuated?  It is inevitable.  Even if a person’s \nmind is only slightly disturbed, he still falls from the path of kalyãn.  \nGADHADÃ II \n- 431 - \nTherefore, all of this proves to be a great obstacle for those who \nworship Bhagvãn via the rasik path. \n \n3.5 \n“Now, brahm-gnãn (knowledge of the ãtmã) can also give rise to the \nfollowing incorrect understanding:  brahm itself assumes the svarup \nof Prakruti-Purush.  Then, that brahm itself assumes the svarup of \nBrahmã, Vishnu, and Shiv.  Thereafter, brahm assumes the sthãvar \nand jangam svarups of creation.  Subsequently, brahm also becomes \nthe jeevs residing in those sthãvar and jangam svarups of creation.  By \nmisunderstanding brahm-gnãn in this way, a person then believes his \nown jeev to be Bhagvãn, which causes him to betray his upãsanã.  As \na result, he also falls from the path of Bhagvãn.  So, in the path of \nbrahm-gnãn, such a betrayal of his upãsanã is a major obstacle.  This \nis because the very Bhagvãn who is to be understood as the cause \nand master of everything has been insulted.  Therefore, a person with \nthis understanding should also be known to have fallen from the path \nof kalyãn. \n \n3.6 \n“Now, while these two paths do lead to kalyãn, the obstacles along \nthe way are also extremely damaging.  So, what should a person who \ndesires kalyãn do?  Please answer this question.” \n \n3.7 \nAll the paramhans then began to think, but no one was able to supply \na suitable answer. \n \n3.8 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then said, “The answer to the question is as follows:  \nA person’s mind does not become infatuated on seeing his own \nmother, sister, or daughter, even if they are very beautiful.  Moreover, \neven though he may talk with them, or even touch them, his mind is \nnot even slightly infatuated.  In the same way, if a person were to \nconsider all female bhaktas of Bhagvãn as his own mother, sister, or \ndaughter, then infatuation would not arise in any way at all.  Then, by \nworshipping Bhagvãn via the rasik path, he would attain kalyãn. \n \n3.9 \n“However, when a person does not have such understanding, and has \nlustful thoughts on seeing some great female bhaktas of Bhagvãn, his \nGADHADÃ II \n- 432 - \ncharacter becomes extremely flawed.  Furthermore, the flaw arising \nfrom lustfully looking at other women is eradicated by having the \ndarshan of a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  However, the shãstras mention no \nmethod of eradicating the flaw arising from lustfully looking at a \nbhakta of Bhagvãn.  The same applies for a female who look at a male \nbhakta of Bhagvãn and has lustful thoughts; they too can never be \nredeemed of that sin.  This is described in the following verse:  \n \nanya-kshetre krutam pãpam tirth-kshetre vina-shyati \ntirth-kshetre krutam pãpam vajra-lepo bhavi-shyati \nSins committed elsewhere are destroyed at a place of pilgrimage, \nbut sins committed at a place of pilgrimage are as though etched in iron. \n \n \n“The verse means:  ‘Sins committed elsewhere can be removed by \ngoing to Bhagvãn or a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  However, if a person \ncommits a sin before Bhagvãn or His bhakta, then it is like committing \na sin at a place of pilgrimage; it becomes irredeemable, as if etched in \niron’.  Therefore, a person who wishes to worship Bhagvãn via the \nrasik path, should keep his mind pure, as I have explained. \n \n3.10 “Now, a person on the path of brahm-gnãn, should understand that \nbrahm is not subject to change and is indivisible.  Therefore, it does \nnot undergo change, and it cannot be divided.  When that brahm is \nequated with all svarups, it is because that brahm is the cause of \nPrakruti-Purush, and the cause of all.  It is their supporter, and it \npervades all through its antaryãmi powers.  Furthermore, that which \nis the cause, the supporter, and which pervades everything, cannot \nbe distinct from its effect.  It is in reference to this context that the \nshãstras equate that brahm with all forms.  However, a person should \nnot believe that brahm itself undergoes change and assumes the \nforms of all sthãvar and jangam beings. \n \n3.11 “Also, greater than that brahm is Parbrahm Purushottam Nãrãyan, \nwho is distinct from brahm, and is the cause, the supporter, and the \ncontroller of brahm.  With this understanding, a person should \nGADHADÃ II \n- 433 - \ndevelop oneness with his jeevãtmã and with that brahm, and worship \nBhagvãn while maintaining a master-servant relationship with Him.  \nWith this understanding, brahm-gnãn also becomes an unobstructed \npath to attaining Akshardhãm.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 3 || 136 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 4 \nThe Loss Of Dharma And Bhakti  \n \n4.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1878, on Shrãvan sud 5[3rd August 1821], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda outside the \nwest-facing medi in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was \ndressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.  Some of \nthe paramhans were singing kirtans in the malãr rãg to the \naccompaniment of a dukad, sarodã, and satãr. \n \n4.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please stop the singing, and let us now \ntalk about Bhagvãn.” \n \n4.3 \nThe paramhans responded, “Very well, Mahãrãj.” \n \n4.4 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Suppose a person, who follows dharma \nas prescribed in the shãstras and also offers bhakti to Bhagvãn, is \nfaced with such unpleasant circumstances that if he tries to maintain \nbhakti, he is forced to lapse in his observance of dharma, and if he \ntries to maintain his observance of dharma, then he is forced to \nabandon bhakti.  In such a case, which should he maintain, and which \nshould he abandon?” \n \n4.5 \nBrahmãnand Swãmi replied, “If Bhagvãn is pleased by upholding \nbhakti, then bhakti should be upheld; and if He is pleased by \nupholding dharma, then dharma should be upheld.” \nGADHADÃ II \n- 434 - \n4.6 \nHearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj countered, “For those who have found \npratyaksha Bhagvãn, it is of course appropriate for them to do only \nthat which pleases Bhagvãn.  But, what should a person do when \nBhagvãn is not pratyaksha?” \n \n4.7 \nMuktãnand Swãmi attempted to answer, but he was unable to do so \nsatisfactorily. \n \n4.8 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then said, “If a person faces unpleasant \ncircumstances when Bhagvãn is not pratyaksha and there is no one \nelse left to turn to, if he constantly thinks only about Bhagvãn, he will \nnot fall from the path of Bhagvãn.” \n \n4.9 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked another question, “A person who \nthoroughly understands the greatness of Bhagvãn feels, ‘No matter \nhow many sins a person may have committed, if he merely utters the \nname of Bhagvãn even once, all of his sins will be burnt to ashes’.  What \nunderstanding should a person with this belief develop, so that he \nnever falters from the observance of dharma?” \n \n4.10 Again, Muktãnand Swãmi attempted to answer, but was unable to do \nso satisfactorily. \n \n4.11 So, replying to His own question, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A person who \nthoroughly realises Bhagvãn’s greatness can still abide by dharma if \nhe develops the following understanding:  ‘I want to constantly think \nabout Bhagvãn and become an ekãntik bhakta.  However, if my vrutti is \ndrawn towards vicious natures, such as kãm, krodh, and lobh, then that \nwill be an obstruction in my thoughts of Bhagvãn’.  Realising this, he \nremains extremely cautious of treading the wrong path.  As a result, \nhe would never do anything related to adharma.  If a person has this \nunderstanding, then even though he thoroughly realises the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn, he would never falter in his observance of \ndharma. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 435 - \n4.12 “Indeed, it is not a small deed to be able to think about Bhagvãn \nconstantly; if a person were to leave his body while thinking about \nBhagvãn, he would attain Akshardhãm.” \n \n4.13 Then, Brahmãnand Swãmi asked, “We do realise this, yet we still \ncannot constantly think about Bhagvãn.  What is the reason for this?” \n \n4.14 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “First of all, to be able to constantly think \nabout Bhagvãn, a person needs shraddhã.  If he does not have such \nshraddhã, it implies that there is a deficiency in realising Bhagvãn’s \ngreatness.  When there is this deficiency, it suggests that there is also \na deficiency in his nishchay in the svarup of Bhagvãn.  So, if a person \nrealises the greatness of Bhagvãn and also has shraddhã, then he will \nbe able to constantly think about Bhagvãn. \n \n4.15 “Furthermore, Bhagvãn’s greatness should be understood as follows:  \nBhagvãn, who is greater than Prakruti-Purush, is the very same when \nhe enters them; He still retains His divya powers.  Even after He \nenters the entities evolved from Prakruti-Purush, like the brahmãnd, \nHe retains the very same powers; but, in no way do traces of Mãyã \naffect Bhagvãn’s murti.  For example, consider the difference between \ngold and other metals.  When they are buried together in the ground \nfor a long period of time, all the metals other than the gold will \ndecompose into the dirt surrounding them.  In comparison, the \nlonger the gold stays in the ground, the more valuable it becomes, as \nit does not decompose in any way. \n \n4.16 “Similarly, Bhagvãn, devs such as Brahmã and others, or other munis \nare not all the same.  This is because when they come into contact \nwith dirt (vishays), then all except Bhagvãn become engrossed in \nthose vishays, regardless of how great they may be.  Moreover, \nalthough Bhagvãn seems to be like a human, there is no worldly \nobject capable of affecting Him.  Regardless of how attractive a vishay \nmay be, He is never tempted by it.  This is the alokik power of \nGADHADÃ II \n- 436 - \nBhagvãn.  If a person realises this greatness, he will be able to \nconstantly think about Bhagvãn. \n \n4.17 “However, as long as a bhakta is attracted to vishays, he has not \nrealised Bhagvãn’s alokik greatness at all.  For example, Bhagvãn said \nto Uddhavji, ‘O Uddhav!  You are not even slightly lesser than me’.  This \nwas because Uddhavji had realised Bhagvãn’s alokik greatness, and \ntherefore was not attracted by the panch-vishays. \n \n4.18 “For a person who realises the greatness of Bhagvãn, to rule a \nkingdom or to have to beg for food, are both equivalent.  He also feels \nthe same towards a young girl, a 16-year-old girl, and an 80-year old \nwoman.  In fact, he views all the attractive and repulsive objects in \nthis world as being equal; he does not get tempted by an attractive \nobject as a moth does by a lamp.  In fact, he is not tempted by any \nobject except for Bhagvãn; he is only attracted to the murti of \nBhagvãn.  A bhakta who behaves in this way, never becomes bound \nby vishays, regardless of how tempting they may be. \n \n4.19 “However, if a person has not understood this key principle, then it \nwould be very difficult for him to detach his mind from even a torn \nwaistcloth or a water-pot.  Therefore, without realising Bhagvãn’s \ngreatness in this way, even if a person makes an effort in a million \nother ways, he will still not be able to constantly think about the \nmurti of Bhagvãn.  Only a person who realises the greatness of \nBhagvãn is able to constantly think about Him.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 4 || 137 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 5 \nFidelity And Courage \n \n5.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1878, on Shrãvan sud 7[5th August 1821], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a square cushion which \nGADHADÃ II \n- 437 - \nhad been placed on the platform in front of the mandir of Shree \nVãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was \ndressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.  Some of \nthe paramhans were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a \nmrudang. \n \n5.2 \nThen, with a gesture of His eyes, Shreeji Mahãrãj stopped the kirtans \nand said, “Everyone please listen, as I wish to speak.  A bhakta of \nBhagvãn should firstly maintain pati vratã, and secondly maintain \ncourage.  For example, consider a pati-vratã wife who abides by the \nvow of fidelity.  Even if her husband is old, sick, poor, or ugly, the \nmind of that pati-vratã wife would never sway upon seeing the \nqualities of another man.  Even if a beggar’s wife, who observes this \nvow, were to see a great king, her mind would not waver.  In a similar \nway, a bhakta of Bhagvãn should follow the vow of pati vratã with \nBhagvãn. \n \n5.3 \n“Furthermore, if someone were to speak ill of a woman’s husband, \nthen she will not remain timid and quiet.  Instead, she will reply very \ncourageously.  In this way, a bhakta of Bhagvãn should not become \nsuppressed by evil people; he should be courageous. \n \n5.4 \n“It is generally said that a sãdhu should view everyone equally.  \nHowever, this is not the principle of the shãstras, as bhaktas like \nNãrad, the Sanakãdik, Dhruv, and Prahlãd, have taken the side of only \nBhagvãn and His bhaktas; they have never taken the side of vimukhs.  \nA person who does side with a vimukh, will himself definitely become \na vimukh as well, either in this life or in the next.  Therefore, a bhakta \nof Bhagvãn should certainly side with Bhagvãn’s bhaktas and \nabandon the side of vimukhs.  Please firmly remember this talk of \nmine.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 5 || 138 || \nGADHADÃ II \n- 438 - \nGadhadã II – 6 \nVidhi And Nishedh \nThe Nature Of The Chitt \n \n6.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1878, on Shrãvan sud 8 [6th August 1821], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Swãmi was sitting on a square platform in front \nof the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of \nparamhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him.  Some of the paramhans were singing kirtans to the \naccompaniment of a mrudang. \n \n6.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please stop the singing and lets us now \ntalk about Bhagvãn.” \n \n6.3 \nThen, all the munis sat with their hands folded.  Shreeji Mahãrãj then \ncontinued, “In this world, there are many people who are like nãstiks.  \nThey believe, ‘Water from the Gangã and other water seems the same; \nshãligrãms and other stones seem the same; tulsi and other trees seem \nthe same; a brãhman and a shudra seem equal; food which is the \nprasãd of Bhagvãn and other food seems the same; to do upvãs on the \nday of Ekãdashi and to go hungry on any other day seems the same; \nand a sãdhu and a non-sãdhu also seem the same.  Despite this, why \nhave those great men made distinctions in the form of vidhi and \nnishedh in the shãstras?’  This is what is said by people with evil \nminds.  That is why I put this question to all of you sãdhus:  Are those \ndistinctions, in the form of vidhi and nishedh prescribed in the \nshãstras by great men, genuine or fictional?  May the junior \nparamhans answer this question.” \n \n6.4 \nThe junior paramhans replied, “The distinctions in the form of vidhi \nand nishedh are indeed genuine.  If this were not so, how could there \nbe a distinction as to who deserves to attain Svarg-Lok and who \ndeserves to attain Narak?” \nGADHADÃ II \n- 439 - \n6.5 \nHearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj commented, “They are young, but they \nunderstand well.”  Shreeji Mahãrãj then elaborated upon the answer \nHimself.  “Whatever the great men of the past have prescribed in the \nshãstras is genuine.  Take the example of a wealthy businessman.  If \nhe writes a cheque to pay some other merchant, then although it \nseems that the piece of paper is not worth even a single rupee, it is \nindeed money.  Only when the merchant cashes the cheque the \nbusinessman had signed, does the merchant subsequently receive a \nlarge sum of money from that very same cheque.  Similarly, although \nat the time there may not seem to be any benefit in following the \nvidhi and nishedh, a person who does follow dharma by the ãgnã of a \ngreat sant, ultimately attains kalyãn – just as a person receives cash \nfrom cheques. \n \n6.6 \n“Moreover, a person who does not trust a cheque signed by a wealthy \nbusinessman should be known to be a fool – because he does not \nrealise the wealth of that businessman.  Similarly, a person who does \nnot trust the words of great bhaktas, such as Nãrad, the Sanakãdik, \nVyãs, and Vãlmik, should be known as a nãstik and a great sinner. \n \n6.7 \n“Furthermore, a person who has such a nãstik attitude believes, \n‘What is the difference between Bhagvãn’s murti and other stones?  All \nstones are one and the same.  What is the difference between a married \nwoman and an unmarried woman?  All women are equal.  What is the \ndifference between a person’s wife, mother, or sister?  After all, they all \nlook alike.  In fact, even all the avatãrs of Bhagvãn, such as Rãm and \nKrishna, look like humans.  Surely, the concept of them being greater or \nlesser has been created by man’s imagination.  But, what can we do?  \nWe have to live with such people, so we have to agree with whatever \nthey say.  Nevertheless, the vidhi and nishedh prescribed by the shãstras \nare definitely nonsense’.  This is the understanding that sinners such \nas the nãstiks have in their minds.  If a person hears such words from \nsomeone, then the listener should be known as a sinner and a nãstik; \nand realising him to be an outcast, he should by no means keep his \ncompany.” \nGADHADÃ II \n- 440 - \n6.8 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then began another topic.  He said, “The chitt of all \npeople is like honey, or like water saturated with sugar.  For example, \nif a fly or an ant were to fall into that honey or water saturated with \nsugar, it would become stuck in it.  Even if a person were to touch the \nhoney or saturated water, it would stick to the person’s finger as \nwell.  The nature of the chitt is similar to this; it sticks to whatever \nobject it recalls.  In fact, the chitt even attaches itself to things that are \nutterly insignificant, such as stones, or rubbish, or dog excrement – \nthings in which there is not even the slightest pleasure.  If it recalls \nsuch useless things, it will then also think about them.  This is its \nsticky nature. \n \n6.9 \n“Furthermore, just as the reflection of a great sãdhu will be seen in a \nlarge, glass mirror if he stands before it, the reflection of a dog, a \ndonkey, or an outcaste will also be seen if they stand before it.  \nSimilarly, the chitt is extremely pure; it can visualise whichever \nobject it recalls, regardless of whether it is appealing or not.  \nTherefore, a mumukshu should not think, ‘As I do not possess vairãgya, \nobjects such as women and other attractive vishays develop in my \nchitt’.  In actual fact, objects develop naturally even in the chitt of a \nperson who does possess vairãgya.  Therefore, vairãgya or the lack of \nit is not the reason behind this.  Instead, the nature of the chitt is such \nthat whatever it recalls; whether it is good or bad, the chitt thinks \nabout.  When it thinks about an object, it appears just as it would \nappear in mirror.  That is why a person should realise, ‘I am distinct \nfrom the chitt.  I am the ãtmã, the observer of the chitt’.  Realising this, \nhe should not become frustrated by the pure and impure thoughts \narising in the chitt.  Instead, he should realise himself to be distinct \nfrom his chitt, engage in the worship of Bhagvãn, and always remain \njoyful.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 6 || 139 || \n \n \nGADHADÃ II \n- 441 - \nGadhadã II – 7 \nEradicating Svabhãvs \n \n7.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1878, on the night of Shrãvan sud 11 [9th August \n1821], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in front of the \nmandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of \nparamhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n7.2 \nThen, Muktãnand Swãmi asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “A bhakta of \nBhagvãn decides in his mind, ‘I do not want to retain a single svabhãv \nwhich may obstruct me in worshipping Bhagvãn’.  However, \ninappropriate svabhãvs still remain within him.  What is the reason \nfor this?” \n \n7.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a person has a deficiency of vairãgya, then \neven if he has the shraddhã to eradicate his svabhãvs, they will not be \neradicated.  For example, a poor man may wish for lots of delicious \nfood and lavish clothes, but how can he acquire them?  Similarly, a \nperson who lacks vairãgya may wish in his heart to acquire the \nqualities of a sãdhu, but it is very difficult for him to do so.” \n \n7.4 \nMuktãnand Swãmi then asked, “If a person does not possess \nvairãgya, what method should he adopt to eradicate those vicious \nnatures?” \n \n7.5 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a person lacks vairãgya, but intensely \nserves a great sant, and obeys the ãgnã of Bhagvãn, then Bhagvãn \nwill look upon him with an eye of compassion, and feel, ‘This poor \nman lacks vairãgya; and the vicious natures, like kãm and krodh, are \nharassing him very much.  So, may all of those vicious natures be \neradicated’.  As a result, they will be eradicated immediately.  In \ncomparison, if he were to attempt other methods, those svabhãvs \nGADHADÃ II \n- 442 - \nmay be eradicated, but only after a great deal of time and effort – \neither in this life or in later lives.  If such vicious natures are \neradicated instantly, then it should be known that they have been \neradicated by the grace of Bhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 7 || 140 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 8 \nEkãdashi \nGnãn-Yagna \nAntar-Drashti \n \n8.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1878, in the early morning of Shrãvan sud 12 [10th \nAugust 1821], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a \nsquare cushion in front of the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in \nDãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him.  Some of the paramhans were \nsinging kirtans to the accompaniment of a mrudang. \n \n8.2 \nThen, addressing the sãdhus, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A person should \nkeep the Ekãdashi vrat because of the following story:  Once, Bhagvãn \nwas sleeping with his ten indriyas and the mind (eleventh indriya) \ndrawn inwards.  At that time, Mur-Dãnav, the son of Nãdi-Jandh, \ncame to do battle with Bhagvãn.  A young woman was then created \nfrom the divine light of Bhagvãn’s eleven indriyas.  Seeing her, Mur-\nDãnav proposed to her, ‘Please marry me’.  The young woman replied, \n‘I have taken a vow that I will only marry the person who defeats me in \na battle’.  This resulted in a battle between Mur-Dãnav and the young \nwoman, in which the young woman cut off Mur-Dãnav’s head with a \nsword.  Bhagvãn was pleased with her and said, ‘Ask for a vardãn’.  \nThe young woman requested, ‘On my day of vrat, no one should eat \ngrains.  Furthermore, as I was born from the divine light of your eleven \nindriyas, my name is Ekãdashi.  As I am a tyãgi, on my day of vrat, no \none should indulge in any of the vishays related to the eleven indriyas, \nGADHADÃ II \n- 443 - \nwhich includes the mind’.  Hearing Ekãdashi’s wish, Bhagvãn granted \nher that vardãn.  This is the story as it is narrated in the Purãns. \n \n8.3 \n“The Dharma-Shãstras also state:  ‘The Ekãdashi vrat should be kept.  \nOn that day, a person should not allow impure thoughts, such as kãm, \nkrodh, and lobh, to arise in the mind; nor should he physically engage \nin any immoral activities’.  This is what the shãstras prescribe.  In \nagreement with those shãstras, I also say that on the day of Ekãdashi, \na person should not merely do upvãs, but he should also abandon the \n‘food’ of the eleven indriyas.  Only then can the Ekãdashi vrat be \nconsidered true; without that, it should be known as mere upvãs. \n \n8.4 \n“Just as the prãns have their diet (food), the ears have a diet of \nsounds, the eyes have a diet of sights, the tongue has a diet of tastes, \nthe nose has a diet of smells, and the mind has a diet of thoughts and \ndesires.  In this way, the eleven indriyas have their diets.  To give up \nall these is called Ekãdashi vrat.  However, to allow the eleven \nindriyas to roam freely along the path of immorality and indulge in \ntheir ‘foods’ is not truly Ekãdashi according to the shãstras.  \nTherefore, when keeping an Ekãdashi vrat, the eleven indriyas should \nnot be allowed their ‘foods’.  As this vrat arrives once every fifteen \ndays, a person should definitely make a point of keeping it.  In return, \nBhagvãn will become pleased.  Without this, merely doing upvãs does \nnot please Him. \n \n8.5 \n“The residents of Shvet-Dvip, who are called niranna-muktas, are \ncontinuously keeping this vrat, and they never allow it to be broken.  \nThat is precisely why they are called niranna muktas.  We too should \nhave such aspirations as, ‘I want to become like those niranna-muktas \nin Shvet-Dvip’.  However, a person should not lose courage.  Only if he \nkeeps courage and keeps the Ekãdashi vrat in the way I have \nmentioned, listens to kathãs and kirtans of Bhagvãn, and also stays \nawake at night, is the vrat considered to have been kept properly.  \nThis is the very definition of the Ekãdashi vrat as mentioned in the \nshãstras.” \nGADHADÃ II \n- 444 - \n8.6 \nHaving said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj became silent.  The sãdhus then \nbegan to sing kirtans. \n \n8.7 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj again said, “When Brahmã carried out the very \nfirst creation, he told all the people, ‘You should all perform yagnas.  \nThrough them you will attain all the purushãrths, and the process of \ncreation will also flourish.  Therefore, be sure to perform these \nsacrifices’.  Brahmã then demonstrated the many different types of \nyagnas, along with their rituals, as described in the Veds.  To those \nwho had adopted the path of pravrutti, Brahmã demonstrated the \nrãjasi and tãmasi yagnas.  To those who had adopted the path of \nnivrutti, he demonstrated sãttvik yagnas.  These yagnas have also \nbeen described by Shree Krishna Bhagvãn in the Bhagvad Geetã.  \nSince we have adopted the path of nivrutti, we should perform sãttvik \nyagnas, not rãjasi or tãmasi yagnas in which animals are slaughtered. \n \n8.8 \n“A person can perform a sãttvik yagna by withdrawing the ten \nindriyas and the mind (the eleventh indriya) from whichever vishays \nthey have become attached to, and then offering them into brahm-\nagni.  This is called a yog-yagna.  By continuously making these \nofferings, Parbrahm Shree Purushottam incarnates Himself with the \nbrahm-svarup self of the person who performs a yoga-yagna, just as \nBhagvãn grants darshan to the performer of a yagna.  In fact, this is \nthe reward of the yog-yagna. \n \n8.9 \n“Also, when a bhakta of Bhagvãn engages in antar-drashti, it is called \na gnãn-yagna.  Someone may ask, ‘What is antar-drashti?’  The \nanswer is:  To direct a person’s internal or external vrutti towards \nthe murti of Bhagvãn is itself antar-drashti.  Without doing this, even \nif a person is sitting and seemingly engaged in antar-drashti, it is still \nbãhya-drashti.  Therefore, physical activities related to Bhagvãn, such \nas having the darshan of Bhagvãn, performing His pujã or engaging in \nkathã and kirtans of Bhagvãn, are all forms of antar-drashti.  All of \nthese are aspects of a gnãn-yagna.  In addition, to see that murti of \nGADHADÃ II \n- 445 - \nBhagvãn within the heart, to perform its pujã, and to bow before it, is \nalso antar-drashti, and they are also aspects of a gnãn-yagna.  For this \nreason, all satsangis are continuously performing gnãn-yagna.  \nHowever, it is by the wish of Bhagvãn that some attain samãdhi and \nothers do not.  Sometimes it could also be that the bhakta himself has \nsome sort of deficiency. \n \n8.10 “There are foolish people who say, ‘Do not sing kirtans which describe \nthe gopis; sing only nirgun kirtans’.  Those same fools claim that a \nperson who roams around naked is nirgun.  But, if a person could \nbecome nirgun by merely walking around naked, then even dogs, \ndonkeys, and other animals would be called nirgun.  This is the \nunderstanding of fools. \n \n8.11 “In comparison, a bhakta possessing gnãn understands that only the \nsvarup Bhagvãn is nirgun, and all those who have some relation to \nBhagvãn are followers of the nirgun path.  Furthermore, any kathã or \nkirtan associated with Bhagvãn is also considered nirgun.  However, \nkathã or kirtan which are not associated with Bhagvãn possess mãyik \nqualities, and should be considered to be sagun.  So, if a person has \nnot been graced with the attainment of Bhagvãn, then even if he \nwalks around naked, he cannot be called nirgun; whereas even if a \ngrahastha has been graced with the attainment of Bhagvãn, he can \nstill be called nirgun – as can a tyãgi.’  Therefore, the path to attaining \nBhagvãn is itself the nirgun path, and all activities related to Bhagvãn \nare therefore also nirgun. \n \n8.12 “As for a person who has come into contact with Bhagvãn, there is no \nlimit to his good fortune.  However, such a relationship with Bhagvãn \nis not the result of rewards from one life alone.  That is why Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn has stated in the Bhagvad Geetã: \n \nanek-janma-sansiddh-stato yãti parãm gatim \nA yogi who has become siddh after many lives, attains Akshardhãm. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 446 - \n \n“The meaning of this shlok is:  ‘A person becomes a yogi and attains \nAkshardhãm after the good deeds of many lives have accumulated’.  \nWhat is this Akshardhãm?  Well, the attainment of the pratyaksha \nBhagvãn is itself Akshardhãm. \n \n8.13 “Shree Krishna Bhagvãn has also said: \n \nmamai-vãnsho jeev-loke jeev-bhootaha sanãtanaha \nmanaha-shashthã-neendriyãni prakruti-sthãni karshati \n \n \n“This shlok means:  ‘In this world, those jeevs who are bhaktas of \nBhagvãn withdraw their mind and five gnãn-indriyas away from the \npanch-vishays and keep them suppressed.  On the other hand, those \nwho are not bhaktas of Bhagvãn are drawn by their indriyas and are \ntaken where the indriyas wish to go’.  As we are not led astray by our \nindriyas, we should realise ourselves to be bhaktas of Bhagvãn.  With \nthis understanding, we should remain joyful, should engage in the \nworship of Bhagvãn, and should offer all the vruttis of our indriyas to \nBhagvãn.  We should continuously perform a gnãn-yagna in this way. \n \n8.14 “Without performing such yagnas, there is no way to attain kalyãn.  \nThe four Veds, the Sãnkhya shãstras, the Yog shãstras, the Dharma-\nShãstras, the eighteen Purãns, the Mahãbhãrat, the Rãmãyan, the \nNãrad Panch-Rãtra, and all other shãstras, share the principles that \nkalyãn cannot be attained without performing yagnas. \n \n8.15 “It is also my ãgnã that all paramhans and all satsangis should \ncontinue performing a gnãn-yagna.  While performing a gnãn-yagna \nin this way, a person ultimately has the divine darshan of Parbrahm \nwithin his own self, which is brahm.  This is the reward of the gnãn-\nyagna.  The highest point of the gnãn-yagna ritual is when a person \nbecomes like a niranna-mukta of Shvet-Dvip.  As long as a person has \nnot attained this state, he should realise that the gnãn-yagna is \nincomplete.  In fact, he should have a strong desire to become like a \nniranna-mukta.  In the process, he should not lose faith, and he \nGADHADÃ II \n- 447 - \nshould not consider himself to be unfulfilled.  Since he has been \ngraced with the attainment of Bhagvãn, he should consider himself to \nbe absolutely fulfilled, and he should attentively continue performing \nthe gnãn-yagna.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 8 || 141 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 9 \nNever Insult The Svarup Of Bhagvãn \n \n9.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1878, on Shrãvan sud 14 [12th August 1821], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a square cushion in \nfront of the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Gadhadã.  Ãnandãnand Swãmi had just performed His pujã.  \nShreeji Mahãrãj was wearing a red survãl and dagli made from \nkinkhãb.  He had tied an orange reto with a golden border around His \nhead, and had tied an embroidered shelu around His waist.  On His \nshoulder was a sky-blue coloured reto.  Several rãkhadis were tied \naround His wrist.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n9.2 \nThen, Muktãnand Swãmi suggested, “Let us sing kirtans.” \n \n9.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj said, “Let us talk about Bhagvãn.”  He then continued, \n“The path of gnãn should be understood in a way that does not cause \na person to criticise the svarup of Bhagvãn in any way.  In fact, a \nperson should not worry if at some time or other he has disobeyed \nBhagvãn’s ãgnãs; but he should never criticise the svarup of Bhagvãn.  \nIf he does disobey Bhagvãn’s ãgnãs, then he can still be freed from \nthat sin by praying to Bhagvãn.  However, there are no means of \nrelease for a person who has criticised the svarup of Bhagvãn.  \nTherefore, a person who is wise should certainly abide by Bhagvãn’s \nãgnãs to the best of his ability.  However, he should also intensely \nmaintain the strength of belief in Bhagvãn’s svarup: ‘I have attained \nGADHADÃ II \n- 448 - \nthe very svarup of Bhagvãn who reigns supreme, who forever possesses \na divya svarup, and who is the ‘avatãri’ – the cause of all the avatãrs’.  \nIf a person realises this, then even if he may have left satsang, his love \nfor Bhagvãn’s svarup will not diminish.  In fact, even though he is out \nof satsang at present, when he leaves his body, he will go to \nBhagvãn’s Akshardhãm and stay near Bhagvãn. \n \n9.4 \n“On the other hand, a person may be in satsang, and he may even be \nabiding by the ãgnãs prescribed in the shãstras.  However, if his belief \nof Bhagvãn is not firm, then when he leaves his body, he will either go \nto the lok of Brahmã or to the lok of some other dev; but he will not go \nto the dhãm of Purushottam Bhagvãn.  Therefore, a person should \nbelieve that the pratyaksha Bhagvãn that he has attained possesses a \ndivya svarup, and is the ‘avatãri’ – the cause of all the avatãrs.  \nHowever, if a person does not have this belief, and instead believes \nBhagvãn to be nirãkãr or like the other avatãrs, then that is regarded \nas committing blasphemy against Bhagvãn. \n \n9.5 \n“Now, consider the following:  Arjun’s spiritual strength was based \non his belief of Bhagvãn, whereas Yudhishthir’s source of strength \nwas his faith in the words of the shãstras.  Then, when the \nMahãbhãrat war was fought, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn said to Arjun: \n \nsarva-dharmãn-parityajya mãm-ekam sharanam vraja \naham tvam sarva-pãpebhyo mokshayi-shyãmi mã shuchaha \n \n \n“The meaning of this shlok is, ‘O Arjun!  Abandon all the various types \nof dharma and surrender only to me.  I shall deliver you from all sins, so \ndo not grieve’.  By keeping faith in these words, Arjun never became \ndisheartened, despite committing countless misdeeds during the war.  \nHe maintained firm faith in Bhagvãn.  Conversely, Yudhishthir had \nnot committed any sins, but because he had faith in the words of the \nshãstras, he felt, ‘I shall never attain kalyãn’.  Even when all the rushis, \nVyãsji, and even Shree Krishna Bhagvãn Himself attempted to explain \nto him, still he did not abandon his guilt.  Yudhishthir only developed \nGADHADÃ II \n- 449 - \nsome faith when Shree Krishna Bhagvãn took him to Bhishma and \nhad him listen to Bhishma’s kathã on the true meaning of the words \nof the shãstras.  However, he did not become totally free of doubt like \nArjun.  Therefore, a person who is intelligent should maintain intense \nbelief of the svarup of Bhagvãn. \n \n9.6 \n“Even the slightest strength based on the belief of Bhagvãn, will \nprotect a person from great dangers.  Shree Krishna Bhagvãn has also \nsaid,  \n \nsvalpa-mapyasya dharmasya trãyate mahato bhayãt \n \n \n \n“This shlok means, ‘If a person has the slightest strength based on the \nbelief of Bhagvãn, it will protect him from great misfortune.  For \nexample, when Arjun fought in the Mahãbhãrat war, he encountered \nmany types of severe dangers in the form of adharma.  However, he \nwas spared from those dangers because of his belief of Bhagvãn.  \nTherefore, only he can be called an ekãntik bhakta whose strength is \nbased on the belief of Bhagvãn more than anything else; and only he \ncan be called a perfect satsangi.  The Shreemad Bhãgvat also \nmentions: ‘If a person strays from the dharma stated in the Shrutis and \nSmrutis, he should not worry.  However, he should never abandon the \nrefuge of Bhagvãn’. \n \n9.7 \n“As a result, some may feel, ‘If we promote such talks, dharma will \nbecome irrelevant.’  However, this principle is not intended to make \ndharma irrelevant; its purpose is as follows:  Desh, kãl, kriyã, sang, \nmantras, shãstras, updesh, and devs, can be of two types – pure and \nimpure.  Of these, if a person were to encounter the impure, and if as \na result some difficulties were to arise, then if he has the firm belief of \nBhagvãn, he would never fall from the path of kalyãn.  Conversely, if \nthere is a deficiency in his belief of Bhagvãn, then whenever he falters \nfrom dharma, he would feel, ‘I am destined to fall into Narak’.  \nTherefore, only a person whose strength is based on the belief of \nBhagvãn is a loyal satsangi.  Without this, a person is merely \nGADHADÃ II \n- 450 - \nappreciative of satsang.  Even the shãstras mention that only a person \nwho firmly maintains the belief of Bhagvãn is called an ekãntik \nbhakta.” \n \n9.8 \n “Also, if Nãrad, the Sanakãdik, and the devs, were to hear the talks \nbeing presently delivered in satsang, they would say, ‘We have never \nheard such talks before, and we shall never hear them again’.  These \ntalks can be described as: \n \nna bhooto na bhavishyati \nNever before have there been, and never again will there be. \n \n“Although these talks are extremely small, even a person of average \nintelligence can understand them.  It is as if these talks are \npersonified.  Therefore, there is no limit to the rewards of a person \nwho, at this present time, has a belief of satsang.  Realising this, those \nwho are satsangis should consider themselves to be totally fulfilled.  \nMoreover, a person who has profound love for Bhagvãn, regardless of \nwhether he understands this talk, has nothing left to do.  On the other \nhand, if a person does not have such profound love for Bhagvãn, then \nhe should definitely realise the greatness of Bhagvãn.  Therefore, a \nperson who is wise should think about this talk, understand it, and \nthen take extremely firm refuge in Bhagvãn.  This principle alone is \nthe very essence of all essences.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 9 || 142 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 10 \nNishchay In Bhagvãn \n \n10.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Shrãvan vad 3 [16th August 1821], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj arrived at Lakshmi-Vãdi on horseback \nfrom Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He then sat facing north on \nthe square platform under a mango tree in the middle of a field of \nGADHADÃ II \n- 451 - \nflowers.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of \nparamhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n10.2 Then Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The Shreemad Bhãgvat proclaims that \nBrahm is sãkãr.  However, if those who read it do not have bhakti of \nBhagvãn, they will understand Bhagvãn to be nirãkãr, even from \nreading the Shreemad Bhãgvat.  Also, from the second skandh, which \ndescribes the characteristics of the refuge of Bhagvãn, those who are \nlacking in bhakti will again understand Bhagvãn to be nirãkãr.  In \nreality, Bhagvãn is not nirãkãr.  This is because it is through Bhagvãn \nthat everything sthãvar and jangam is created.  Now, if Bhagvãn was \nnirãkãr, then how could He create something that is sãkãr?  For \nexample, ãkãsh is nirãkãr.  Therefore, trees, mountains, and other \nforms that can be created from pruthvi cannot be created from that \nãkãsh.  In the same way, since Brahmã and the rest of creation is \nsãkãr, Bhagvãn, their creator, is also definitely sãkãr. \n \n10.3 “Also, the Shreemad Bhãgvat states:  ‘The supporter of adhyãtma, \nadhibhut, and adhidev, is Bhagvãn’.  Now, I shall explain how, so \nplease listen carefully.  Adhyãtma (the indriyas of Virãt), adhibhut \n(the five mahã-bhuts of Virãt), and adhidev (the presiding devs of the \nindriyas of Virãt), all entered Virãt.  Despite this, Virãt was unable to \nawaken.  Then, Vãsudev Bhagvãn assumed the svarup of Purush and \nentered Virãt, which caused Virãt-Purush to awaken.  Bhagvãn \ntherefore acts with oneness with the adhyãtma, adhibhut, and \nadhidev of Virãt-Purush.  However, in reality He is distinct from Virãt, \nand only this svarup of Bhagvãn is said to be worthy of seeking \nrefuge. \n \n10.4 “For example, fire in the form of light is nirãkãr, while Agni himself \npossesses a definite murti.  Moreover, when Agni suffered from \nindigestion (unable to digest ghee in the fire), he came to Krishna and \nArjun in his personified svarup.  Then, when he went to burn the \nGADHADÃ II \n- 452 - \nKhãndav forest of Indra, that same Agni assumed the svarup of flames \nand spread throughout the whole forest.  In the same way, \nPurushottam Bhagvãn pervades all through His antaryãmi powers, \nwhich are brahm-rup.  However, possessing a definite murti, He is \nalso distinct from all.  Brahm itself is a ray of the light of Purushottam \nBhagvãn, while Bhagvãn Himself always possesses a murti.  \nTherefore, a person who aspires to attain kalyãn should realise \nBhagvãn to possess a definite murti and should maintain His firm \nrefuge. \n \n10.5 “Also, he should speak in such a way that does not break someone’s \nrefuge of Bhagvãn.  For example, just as a woman who carries a \nfoetus in her womb attains a child, person who carries a foetus \n(nishchay) in Bhagvãn, attains Bhagvãn’s Akshardhãm.  Therefore, a \nperson should practice methods that never endanger the foetus.  He \nshould also talk to others in such a way that that foetus (nishchay) in \nBhagvãn does not miscarry.” \n \n10.6 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj returned to Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr from \nLakshmi-Vãdi.  He sat on a decorated bedstead on the veranda \noutside the east-facing rooms.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n10.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj then summoned the junior paramhans and began a \ndiscussion amongst them.  Achintyãnand Swãmi then asked a \nquestion:  “From gnãn, vairãgya, and bhakti, which one plays a more \nsignificant role in the development of love for Bhagvãn?” \n \n10.8 No, one was able to answer that question.  So, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “I \nshall answer that question, and I shall also describe the \ncharacteristics of gnãn, vairãgya, and bhakti. \n \n10.9 “All people have a tendency such that on seeing an attractive object, \ntheir affection for any object that is not as attractive will naturally \nGADHADÃ II \n- 453 - \ndiminish.  Therefore, before the bliss of Bhagvãn’s Akshardhãm, these \nworldly pleasures seem artificial; permanent bliss can only be found \nin the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  For that reason, if a person realises the bliss \nof Bhagvãn while listening to talks about Bhagvãn, then everything \nthat has evolved from Mãyã will appear worthless.  For example, a \nman with a copper coin in his hand will lose affection for it when \nsomeone offers him a gold coin in exchange.  In the same way, when a \nperson realises the bliss related to Bhagvãn, he develops vairãgya \ntowards all worldly pleasures, and he develops love only for the \nmurti of Bhagvãn.  That is the characteristic of vairãgya. \n \n10.10 “Now, I shall describe the characteristics of gnãn.  There are two sets \nof shãstras that explain gnãn:  One set is the Sãnkhya shãstras, and \nthe other set is the Yog shãstras. \n \n10.11 “Of these, the philosophy of the Sãnkhya shãstras is as follows:  Ãkãsh \npervades pruthvi, jal, tej, and vãyu, and there is not even a tiny speck \nthat is not filled with ãkãsh; still the shortcomings of pruthvi, jal, tej, \nand vãyu, do not effect ãkãsh at all.  In the same way as ãkãsh, no \nmãyik flaw can affect Purushottam Bhagvãn.  This fact is mentioned in \nthe Krishnatãpni Upanishad as follows:  When Durvãsã Rushi came to \nVrundãvan, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn told the gopis, ‘Durvãsã Rushi is \nhungry; so all of you take dishes of food and go to him’. \n \n10.12 “Then, the gopis replied, ‘But, the Yamunã flows along the way.  How \nshall we be able to cross it?’ \n \n10.13 “Shree Krishna Bhagvãn replied, ‘Tell Yamunãji that if Shree Krishna is \nforever a brahm-chãri, then please make way for us’. \n \n10.14 “Laughing, the gopis went to the banks of the Yamunãji and said this.  \nImmediately, Yamunãji gave way.  The gopis fed the rushi, and he in \nturn ate all the food.  Then the gopis asked him, ‘How shall we return \nhome, as the Yamunã flows along the way?’ \nGADHADÃ II \n- 454 - \n10.15 “The rushi then asked them, ‘How did you get here?’ \n \n10.16 “The gopis then explained, ‘Shree Krishna had told us that if he has \nbeen a brahm-chãri since childhood, then ask Yamunãji to give way.  \nTherefore, Yamunãji gave way, and we have come to you’. \n \n10.17 “Hearing this, the rushi said, ‘Tell Yamunãji that if Durvãsã is \ncontinuously fasting, then please give way to us’. \n \n10.18 “Again, laughing, the gopis said this.  Immediately, Yamunãji gave \nway.  On seeing these two incidents, the gopis were totally \nastonished. \n \n10.19 “Therefore, the svarup of Bhagvãn is unaffected in the same way as \nãkãsh.  Despite being the doer of all actions, Bhagvãn still remains a \nnon-doer; and although He is associated with all, He remains \nabsolutely detached.  In this way, the Sãnkhya shãstras describe \nBhagvãn as being unaffected.  To understand this, is gnãn according \nto the Sãnkhya philosophy. \n \n10.20 “Now, I shall explain the philosophy of the Yog shãstras, so please \nlisten.  The philosophy of Yog is that whoever wishes to perform \ndhyãn on Bhagvãn should first stabilise his vision.  To stabilise the \nvision, it should first be fixed upon the murti of Bhagvãn or some \nother object.  Then, while staring at the same object, the vision \nbecomes steady; and with it, the antah-karans also becomes steady.  \nWhen the antah-karans becomes steady, Bhagvãn’s murti should be \nvisualised in the heart.  This would not be difficult for the yogi who \nattempts to visualise the murti; he can behold it quite easily.  \nHowever, if a person does not stabilise his antah-karans through \npractice from the beginning, then when he performs dhyãn on \nBhagvãn, many other types of disturbing thoughts arise and obstruct \nhis path. \n \n10.21 “Therefore, the principle of the Yog shãstras is as follows:  ‘The vrutti \nshould first be stabilised through practice before it is attached to \nGADHADÃ II \n- 455 - \nBhagvãn’.  Realising this is gnãn according to the Yog shãstras.  \nTherefore, to strengthen a person’s understanding through the \nphilosophies of these two shãstras, is known as gnãn. \n \n10.22 “Now, the method of practicing bhakti is as follows:  When the ocean \nwas churned, Lakshmiji emerged from the ocean.  After taking a \nmarriage garland in her hand, Lakshmiji thought, ‘Who is suitable for \nmarriage?  I shall marry him’.  Then, wherever she looked and \nexamined, whoever was handsome lacked qualities, and whoever \npossessed qualities lacked beauty.  In this way, she noticed great \ndeficiencies in many.  She also saw deficiencies in all the devs and all \nthe demons.  Finally, seeing that it was only Bhagvãn who was \ncomplete with all qualities, without any faults at all, and the source of \nall bliss, Lakshmiji developed profound bhakti towards Bhagvãn.  \nWith intense love, she placed the marriage garland around Bhagvãn’s \nneck, and married Bhagvãn.  Therefore, to realise such kalyãn-kãri \nqualities in Bhagvãn and to seek His firm refuge is known as bhakti.” \n \n10.23 Hearing this, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, I have not yet quite \nunderstood which of the three (gnãn, vairãgya, or bhakti) has the \ngreater power in developing love for Bhagvãn.” \n \n10.24 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Bhakti has a lot of power; and while \ngnãn and vairãgya also have power, it is not as much as in bhakti.  \nHowever, true bhakti is extremely rare.  The characteristics of those \nwho possess bhakti are as follows:  When Bhagvãn assumes a svarup \nlike a human and travels on this earth for the sake of the kalyãn of the \njeevs, many of Bhagvãn’s charitras are divya, and many appear to be \nmãyik.  When Bhagvãn assumed the avatãr of Krishna, He gave \ndarshan to Devki and Vasudev in a four-armed svarup; He also lifted \nMount Govardhan; He cleaned Yamunã’s waters of poison by \nremoving Kãliyã-Nãg; He suppressed the infatuation of Brahmã; and \ngave darshan to Akrur in the waters of the Yamunã.  He also \ndispersed the grief of all the Yãdavs by killing the wrestlers, an \nGADHADÃ II \n- 456 - \nelephant, as well as wicked persons like Kans.  Similarly, in the avatãr \nof Rãm, He broke the bow and also dispersed the grief of the devs by \nkilling wicked persons such as Rãvan.  These and other such leelãs \nare known as the divya charitras of Bhagvãn. \n \n10.25 “However, when Sitã was abducted, Rãmchandraji appeared to have \nbecome insane due to constant crying.  In the avatãr of Krishna, He \nfled from Kãlyavan, was defeated by Jarãsandh, and also had to \nsurrender His kingdom in Mathurã to go and settle on an island in the \nsea.  These and other similar actions of Bhagvãn appear to be human-\nlike.  Even a sinner would perceive divya qualities in the divya \ncharitras of Bhagvãn.  However, a true bhakta of Bhagvãn would \nperceive divya qualities even when Bhagvãn performs human-like \ncharitra.  In the Geetã, Bhagvãn has said: \n \njanma karma cha me divyam-evam yo vetti tattva-taha \ntyaktvã deham punar-janma naiti mã-meti sorjuna \n \n \n“This shlok means:  ‘O Arjun!  My birth and my actions are divya.  \nWhoever realises them as divya will not take another birth when he \nleaves his body; instead, he will attain me’.  So, whenever Bhagvãn \nperforms divya charitras, they appear divya to both a bhakta and to a \nperson who is not a bhakta.  However, when Bhagvãn performs \nhuman-like actions, a true bhakta still perceives divya qualities in \nthem, but by no means does he perceive avgun in the human-like \ncharitras of Bhagvãn.  Having this understanding is known as having \nbhakti towards Bhagvãn.  In fact, only such bhaktas earn the rewards \nmentioned in the above shlok. \n \n10.26 “The gopis were bhaktas of Bhagvãn, and they never perceived avgun \nin Bhagvãn in any way.  On the other hand, King Parikshit perceived \navgun in Bhagvãn just by listening to the talks about the gopis.  Shukji \nthen explained those avgun to be false by illustrating the powers of \nBhagvãn.  Therefore, it is very rare to have bhakti in which a person \nperceives all the charitras of Bhagvãn as being divya, as the gopis did, \nGADHADÃ II \n- 457 - \nand never perceives avgun by understanding them to be human-like.  \nIn fact, it is not achieved by merely doing good deeds for one or two \nlives.  Only when the pure sanskãrs of many lives accumulate, does \nbhakti like that of the gopis develop.  In fact, this bhakti is itself \nAkshardhãm.  It is this type of bhakti that is greater than gnãn and \nvairãgya.  If a person has such bhakti in his heart, what would be \nlacking in his love for Bhagvãn?  Nothing would be lacking.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 10 || 143 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 11 \nAll Karmas Becoming A Form Of Bhakti \n \n11.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Shrãvan vad 5  [18th August 1821], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead  under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree \nVãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was \ndressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n11.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “After listening to all the shãstras, some \npeople believe that they only deal with dharma, arth, and kãm.  \nThinking this, they themselves also perform religious karmas, such as \nyagnas and vrats, only for the attainment of dharma, arth, and kãm.  \nAs a result, they enjoy the rewards of these karmas in Dev-Lok, \nBrahm-Lok, or Mrutyu-Lok.  Then, they return to the cycle of births \nand deaths.  Therefore, the religious karmas that a person performs \nwhile holding a desire for dharma, arth, and kãm, all become sãttvik, \nrãjasi, and tãmasi; and the rewards of those karmas are enjoyed \nwhile staying in the loks of Svarg, Mrutyu-Lok, and Pãtãl.  However, \nthey do not attain the gunãtit dhãm of Bhagvãn.  As long as a person \ndoes not attain kalyãn, the miseries of births, deaths, and Narak do \nnot diminish. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 458 - \n11.3 “So, if a person abandons the desire for the rewards related to \ndharma, arth, and kãm, and if he performs religious karmas only to \nplease Bhagvãn, then those religious karmas become a form of bhakti \nand aid in the attainment of kalyãn.  This is described in the following \nshlok: \n \nãmayo yena bhootã-nãm jãyate yash-che suvrat \ntad-eva hyãmayam dravyam na punãti chikit-sitam \nevam nrunam kriyã-yogãha sarve sansruti-hetavaha \nta evãtma-vinãshãya kalpante kalpitãha pare \nO observer of religious vows (Vyãs)!  Does not that same food which causes \nillness in beings – if purified and prescribed by a qualified doctor – cure that \nillness? Similarly, if all of a person’s karmas – which normally cause him to \npass through births and deaths – are offered to Bhagvãn instead, those same \nkarmas are destroyed, and are no longer capable of causing birth and deaths.  \nInstead, they lead to his kalyãn. \n \n \n“The essence of this shlok is as I have described earlier. \n \n11.4 “However, this fact is actually very complex, and if it is not fully \nunderstood, then on seeing a bhakta of Bhagvãn behaving in the \nsame way as all ignorant people do, a person would perceive avgun \nin him.  As a result, the person who perceives the avgun would be \nsent to Narak. \n \n11.5 “But, there is a vast difference between the actions of a bhakta of \nBhagvãn and the actions of a vimukh.  How?  Well, all actions of a \nvimukh are for pampering his indriyas, whereas all actions of a \nbhakta of Bhagvãn are solely for serving Bhagvãn and His bhaktas.  \nAs a result, the bhakta’s actions are a form of bhakti. \n \n11.6 “Moreover, bhakti is like gnãn in the sense that both are a form of \nnon-karma.  Therefore, all of a bhakta’s actions are in a form of \nkarmas that do not cause attachment.  This is described in a shlok in \nthe Bhagvad Geetã: \n \nGADHADÃ II \n- 459 - \nkarmanya-karma yaha pashyed-akarmani cha karma yaha \nsa buddhimãn-manushyeshu sa yuktaha krutsna-karma-krut \n \n \n“The meaning of this shlok is as follows:  If a person sees non-karma \n(gnãn) in the karmas performed by the bhaktas of Bhagvãn for the \npurpose of pleasing Bhagvãn, and he sees a vimukh who has adopted \nthe path of nivrutti as living by non-karmas, then such a person is \nsaid to possess gnãn and is the most intelligent amongst all people; \nhe is a yogi; he is worthy to attain kalyãn, and is krutsna-karma-krut \n(has performed all karmas). \n \n11.7 “Therefore, if a person perceives avgun in a bhakta of Bhagvãn who, \nby Bhagvãn’s ãgnã, performs karmas for the purpose of pleasing \nBhagvãn, then adharma and its followers will enter and reside in his \nheart.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 11 || 144 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 12 \nThe Art Of Ruling \n \n12.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Shrãvan vad 6 [19th August 1821], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in front of the mandir of \nShree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan on the veranda outside the west-facing \nrooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n12.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “I wish to talk to you, so please listen.  In \nthe talk I am about to deliver, I shall describe only one spiritual \nactivity for attaining kalyãn, but it is so powerful that all other \nspiritual activities are incorporated within it.  It is as follows: \n \nGADHADÃ II \n- 460 - \n12.3 “The jeev, which resides in the body, feels, ‘Kãm, krodh, and other \nvicious natures are attached to my jeev’.  In this way, depending on \nwhich of the vicious natures is predominant in a person, he believes \nhis jeev to be full of that nature due to his association with it.  \nHowever, not a single one of these vicious natures lies within the \njeev; the jeev has merely believed itself to possess them out of its own \nfoolishness. \n \n12.4 “Therefore, a person who wishes to attain Akshardhãm should make \nan effort, but he should not relax or lose courage.  Also, he should \nthink, ‘Just as the four antah-karans, the ten indriyas, and the five \nprãns reside in this body, similarly, I am the jeevãtmã, and I also reside \nin this body.  However, I am greater than all of them, and I am their \ncontroller’.  But, he should not think, ‘I am insignificant, whereas the \nantah-karans and indriyas are strong’.  For example, if a king were to \npossess little or no intelligence, then even the members of his own \nfamily would not obey his orders.  When the people in the village \nhear about this, no one in the village would obey his orders.  Also, \nwhen the people throughout the kingdom hear about this, no one in \nthe kingdom would obey his orders.  As a result, the king would \nbecome depressed and powerless.  He would sit idly and would not \nattempt to enforce his rule over anyone. \n \n12.5 “In this analogy, the king symbolises the jeev, the members of the \nhousehold symbolise the antah-karans, and the people of the village \nand kingdom symbolise the indriyas.  So, if the jeev becomes \ndiscouraged and relaxes its authority, then when it wishes to use its \npower over the antah-karans and adjust them towards Bhagvãn, the \nantah-karans will not follow.  Also, if it wishes to control the indriyas, \neven the indriyas will not comply.  Then, even though the jeev is the \nking of the kingdom (body), it becomes helpless like a beggar.  When \na king becomes discouraged, his subjects who live in his kingdom \nassume power and do not allow him to use his authority at all.  \nLikewise, in the kingdom (body) of the jeev, the vicious natures – who \nGADHADÃ II \n- 461 - \nare not the king – take control.  Then, they do not allow the jeev to \nhave any power. \n \n12.6 “Therefore, a person who aspires to attain kalyãn should never \nbecome timid, and should employ whatever measures are necessary \nto force the indriyas and antah-karans to accept his authority – like a \nking who studies books about the art of ruling and then uses \nauthority over his kingdom, but is not suppressed by his subjects.  \nHowever, if the king did not know the art of ruling, the people would \nnot obey his orders.  Instead, they would become unhappy, or he \nhimself would behave miserably because no one would obey his rule.  \nIn this way, not knowing the art of ruling results in two unfortunate \nconsequences.  Similarly, if the jeev were to attempt to rule the \nkingdom (body) without understanding the art of ruling, then it \nwould never become happy.” \n \n12.7 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “How should a \nperson, who wishes to attain kalyãn, learn the art of ruling?” \n \n12.8 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The art of ruling should be learnt in the \nfollowing way:  First of all, a person should thoroughly realise the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn.  Then, he should conquer his mind by \nperforming dhyãn on Bhagvãn’s murti.  He should conquer his ears by \nlistening to talks related to Bhagvãn, but he should not allow worldly \ntalks to be heard by the ears.  In the same way, the skin should only \nbe allowed to touch Bhagvãn and the bhaktas of Bhagvãn.  The eyes \nshould only be allowed to do darshan of Bhagvãn and His bhaktas.  \nThe tongue should forever sing the praises of Bhagvãn and taste only \nthe prasãd of Bhagvãn.  The nose should only be allowed to smell the \nfragrance of flowers and other objects that have been blessed by \nBhagvãn.  None of the indriyas should be allowed to follow the \nunrighteous path.  When a person behaves in this way, no one can \noverthrow his authority in the kingdom (body). \n \nGADHADÃ II \n- 462 - \n12.9 “Only a person who makes an effort in this way and totally discards \ntimidity is said to be walking on the path of kalyãn.  This is an \nextremely great method for overcoming his svabhãvs.  If this method \nof personal effort is practiced vigilantly, then all spiritual activities \nfor attaining kalyãn are incorporated within the one activity.  \nTherefore, personal effort itself is the greatest of all spiritual \nactivities for attaining kalyãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 12 || 145 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 13 \nThe Svarup Within The Divine Light \n \n13.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Shrãvan vad Amãs [27th August 1821], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a square cushion \non the veranda outside the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes and had \ncovered Himself with a white chãdar.  He had also tied a white pãgh \naround His head.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n13.2 Raising both arms in the air, Shreeji Mahãrãj signalled the sabhã to \nsettle down and listen.  Turning to the sãdhus who were humbly \npraying before Him with folded hands, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “O \nparamhans!  All the senior sãdhus, along with those who are wise, \nplease come to the front.  Please listen very carefully to what I am \nabout to say.  What I am about to say to you, I am not saying out of \nany pretence, or out of any pride, or to spread my own greatness.  To \nbe more precise, it is because I feel that amongst all of you sãdhus and \nbhaktas, if someone can understand my message, it will \ntremendously benefit him; that is my purpose in narrating it.  \nMoreover, this talk is based on what I have seen and realised through \nmy own experience.  In fact, it is also in agreement with the shãstras.  \nGADHADÃ II \n- 463 - \nAlthough I feel that it is not appropriate to discuss this in public, I \nshall tell you nonetheless. \n \n13.3 “I naturally remain in a state in which even if I wished to engage my \nmind in the  most charming sounds, the most charming touch, the \nmost charming smells, the most charming tastes, and the most \ncharming sights of this world, I could not do so; I remain absolutely \nunhappy towards them.  In fact, all the attractive vishays and the \nrepulsive vishays are the same to me.  Also, a king and a beggar are \nthe same to me; and to rule all the loks and to beg for food with a \nbroken begging bowl are the same to me; and sitting with honour on \nan elephant and walking on foot are the same to me.  Whether \nsomeone honours me with sandalwood paste, flowers, fine clothes, \nand ornaments, or throws dirt on me – all are the same to me.  \nWhether someone praises me or insults me – both are the same to \nme.  Gold, silver, diamonds, and waste are all the same to me.  \nMoreover, I look upon all bhaktas of Bhagvãn as being equal – I do \nnot differentiate one bhakta as being superior and another bhakta as \nbeing inferior. \n \n13.4 “I have intense vairãgya in my antah-karans, yet I am not burdened \nby it.  I do not feel burdened like a person who carries a heavy rock \non his head or ties a purse full of money and gold coins around his \nwaist.  My strict observance of svadharma does not burden me, nor \ndoes the understanding that I am brahm burden me.  When I \nsuperficially praise an object or criticise another, I do so \npurposefully.  Whenever I forcefully engage the vruttis of my indriyas \ntowards objects, they remain there unwillingly; as soon as I relax that \nforce, they withdraw immediately.  It is like throwing a stone into the \nair – it goes as high as it can depending on the force of the throw, but \nultimately it falls back to earth.  Also, consider the example of a weak \nanimal.  It can stand only as long as a man forcefully supports it; but \nas soon as he withdraws the support, the animal slumps onto the \nground.  In addition, imagine a very strong man who is able to crack a \nGADHADÃ II \n- 464 - \nbetel nut between his teeth.  However, after sucking ten or twenty \nvery sour lemons, he would have great difficulty chewing even \nroasted chick-peas.  In this way, it is only when I forcefully engage my \nvruttis in the vishays that they remain engaged in them. \n \n13.5 “What is the cause of my behaving like this?  Well, it is because the \nvruttis of my indriyas constantly remain inverted towards my hruday-\nãkãsh.  In that hruday-ãkãsh, I see extremely luminous divine light.  \nJust as the clouds cover the entire sky during the monsoon season, \nonly that light pervades my heart. \n \n13.6 “Amidst that divine light I see the extremely luminous murti of \nBhagvãn.  The murti is dark, but due to the intensity of the light, it \nappears to be fair, not dark.  The murti has two arms and two legs, \nnot four, eight or a thousand arms; and its appearance is very \ncharming.  The murti is very tranquil; it has a human svarup; and it \nappears young like a teenager.  Sometimes the murti in the divine \nlight is seen standing; sometimes sitting; and at other times, it is seen \nwalking around.  It is surrounded by groups of muktas on all four \nsides, who are seated facing Him, and who are engaged in looking at \nthat murti of Bhagvãn with a fixed gaze.  I see that murti in its \npratyaksha svarup before me at this very moment.  I saw it before I \ncame into this satsang; I could see it when I was in my mother’s \nwomb; in fact, I could see it even before I entered my mother’s womb.  \nMoreover, I am speaking to you while sitting there (hruday-akãsh).  I \ndo not see this village of Gadhadã or even this veranda.  I see all of \nyou sitting there as well. \n \n13.7 “Whoever realises this svarup will never be drawn towards the \npleasures of the vishays.  In fact, you also see this svarup  of Bhagvãn, \nbut you do not fully understand it.  However, when you come to \nunderstand this fact, you will not come across any difficulty in \nsuppressing the desires of the panch-vishays and svabhãvs, such as \nkãm and krodh; they will be suppressed easily. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 465 - \n13.8 “That consistent divine light is referred to as the ãtmã, Brahm, or \nAkshardhãm.  The murti of Bhagvãn within the light, is called the \nessence of the ãtmã, Parbrahm, or Purushottam.  It is that same \nBhagvãn who, for the kalyãn of countless jeevs, incarnates on this \nearth in different yugs, in the avatãrs such as Rãm and Krishna.  In \nthis lok, He appears to be like a human being, but He is not; He is the \nlord of Akshardhãm.  Shree Krishna Bhagvãn has said in the Geetã: \n \nna tad-bhãsyate suryo na shashanko na pãvakaha \nyad-gatva na nivartante tad-dhãma paramam mama \nMy supreme dhãm is not illuminated by Surya, or by Chandra, or by Agni. \nHaving attained my dhãm, no one returns from it. \n \n \n“Therefore, even though Shree Krishna Bhagvãn appeared to be like a \nhuman, He is still greater than Akshar and is divya. \n \n13.9 “Whoever performs dhyãn on the human murti of Bhagvãn sees the \nluminous, divya murti seated in Akshardhãm.  A person, who \nperforms dhyãn in this way, passes through Mãyã and attains \nAkshardhãm.  So, even though Bhagvãn assumes a human body, He is \nstill divya, and the place where He resides is also nirgun.  His clothes, \njewellery, vehicles, sevaks, food, drinks, and any other objects which \nbecome associated with Him, are all nirgun.  A person, who realises \nBhagvãn’s svarup in this way, does not have any affection for the \npanch-vishays, just like I do not.  He becomes independent. \n \n13.10 “It is this Purushottam, who is greater than Akshar, and who is the \ncause of all avatãrs.  All avatãrs originate from Purushottam, and they \nmerge back into Purushottam.  When Bhagvãn leaves this earth to \nreturn to His dhãm after assuming a human svarup, sometimes His \nphysical body remains on earth like a human being – like when \nRukmani took Shree Krishna’s body into her lap and was engulfed \nalong with it in the fire.  Similarly, Rushabh-Dev’s body was burnt in a \nraging forest fire.  In other instances, His bones and flesh become \ndivya, and He returns to His dhãm without leaving behind any \nGADHADÃ II \n- 466 - \nremains.  When He incarnates, He may sometimes be born of a \nwoman, or He may sometimes appear from whatever He wishes.  In \nthis way, Bhagvãn’s method of birth and death are not always in \naccordance with the ways of this world.  When you thoroughly \nrealise Bhagvãn in this way, you will come across no obstacles on the \npath of kalyãn.  Without this firm understanding of the nature of \nBhagvãn, a person will never be able to overcome his weakness, \nregardless of the amount of tyãg he maintains or the number of upvãs \nhe performs. \n \n13.11 “Then you may say, ‘We have firm understanding of that Bhagvãn just \nas you have described.  Then, why do our prãns and indriyas not \nbecome engaged in Bhagvãn?’  Well, a person should understand that \nas being Bhagvãn’s wish.  In reality, such a person has nothing left to \naccomplish; he is fulfilled and has reached the end of all spiritual \nactivities.  If a person has a firm belief in Bhagvãn, then even if there \nis a slight flaw in remaining nirmãni, nirlobhi, nishkãmi, nisvãdi, or \nnisnehi, there is still nothing to worry about.  However, if any \ndeficiency remains in understanding Bhagvãn, then that flaw will \nnever be eradicated.  Therefore, a person should attempt to \nunderstand this principle by any means within this lifetime. \n \n13.12 “If a person has completely understood the essence of this talk, then \nregardless of whether a person is reborn in a lower or higher life-\nform due to his prãrabdha karmas, like Vrutrãsur, he will not forget \nthis gnãn.  Also, when Bharatji was reborn as a deer, he retained gnãn \nfrom his previous life.  That is the profound greatness of this gnãn.  In \nfact, it is even narrated continuously in the sabhãs of sãdhus such as \nNãrad, the Sanakãdik, and Brahmã and other devs. \n \n13.13 “However, talks regarding the nature of Bhagvãn cannot be \nunderstood by a person on his own; not even from the shãstras.  Even \nthough these facts may be in the shãstras, it is only when the sat-\npurush manifests on this earth, and a person hears them being \nGADHADÃ II \n- 467 - \nnarrated to him, that he understands them.  However, they cannot be \nunderstood by a person’s intellect alone, even from the shãstras. \n \n13.14 “A person who has completely understood the svarup of Bhagvãn, \nand who is also able to see the past, present, and future, still does not \nhave the slightest pride regarding this fact.  He would not grant \nanyone a vardãn, and nor would he curse anyone; but sometimes, he \nmay grant a vardãn or give a curse.  At times, he remains fearless, and \nat other times, he may even become frightened.  Despite that, he \nwould never allow emotions such as happiness or depression to \ncome into his mind.  A person who has such an unflinching refuge of \nBhagvãn would never knowingly perform a bad deed.  However, if \ndue to unpleasant circumstances an improper deed is performed, a \nperson with such a refuge would still not fall from the path of kalyãn.  \nTherefore, there is no other obstacle-free path like that of having the \nfirm refuge of Bhagvãn. \n \n \n \n13.15 “A person who has understood this fact, has only pure intentions.  I \nhave absolutely no selfish expectations from my paramhans and \nsatsangis.  The only reason I may call someone, lecture someone, or \nsend someone away, is that if by any means a person realises this \nfact; it will be very beneficial to them.  So, all of you should firmly \nremember this talk.  \n \n13.16 “Also, you should all understand that the murti amidst the divine \nlight is this Mahãrãj visible before you.  If you cannot do that, then at \nleast realise, ‘Mahãrãj sees the murti which is amidst that akshar-rup \nlight’.  Even if you can understand this much, you will be able to \nmaintain love for me.  As a result, you will attain ãtyantik kalyãn.  \nKeep this principle constantly new and fresh in your minds; never \nforget it out of pride.  Remember it tomorrow just as it is today.  Keep \nit vivid in your minds and remember it daily until the end of your \nlives.  Whenever you talk about Bhagvãn, be sure to implant the \nseeds of this principle.  This is my ãgnã.  Moreover, this principle is \nso vital that you should remember it daily for the rest of your lives.  \nGADHADÃ II \n- 468 - \nIn fact, even after you leave this body and attain a divya svarup, you \nshould recall it.  This principle, which I have revealed before you, is \nthe very essence of all the shãstras, and it is my own firm experience.  \nI have talked to you having seen it with my very own eyes.  In fact, I \ntake oath on all of you paramhans that I have seen these facts with \nmy own eyes.” \n \n13.17 In this way, Shreeji Mahãrãj indirectly described His true identity as \nPurushottam.  Upon hearing this revelation, the sãdhus and bhaktas \naccepted the fact that the murti described amidst the divine light is, \nin fact, Shreeji Mahãrãj Himself. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 13 || 146 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 14 \nNirvikalp Samãdhi \n \n14.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Bhãdarvã sud 1 [28th August 1821], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on veranda outside \nthe north-facing rooms near the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in \nDãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes, \nand had covered Himself with a white chãdar.  Around His head, He \nhad tied a white feto in which a chhoglu of red karnikãr flowers had \nbeen inserted.  A beautiful, kum-kum chãndlo also adorned His \nforehead.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \n \n14.2 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “When a sãdhu attains oneness with \nthe svarup of Bhagvãn, does he attain it through samãdhi, or can he \nalso attain it through some other method?” \n \n14.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Once a person has known that this is a neem \ntree, he never has the doubt in his mind, ‘Is this a neem tree, or not?’  \nSimilarly, if a person has a total understanding of Bhagvãn’s svarup as \nI described yesterday, if he no longer has any doubts about it, and if \nGADHADÃ II \n- 469 - \nhis mind in no way causes his belief of Bhagvãn to waver regardless \nof the type of company he may encounter or the type of shãstras he \nmay hear, then such absolute nishchay is what I call oneness. \n \n14.4 “Such oneness is attained through profound association with an \nekãntik bhakta of Bhagvãn, but not by samãdhi alone.  In fact, such \noneness is itself nirvikalp samãdhi.  Moreover, the sãdhu who has \nsuch nirvikalp samãdhi is also called nirgun brahm.  Regardless of \nwhether he follows the path of nirvrutti or the path of pravrutti, the \nsãdhu who has such an unshakeable nishchay is still nirgun.  For \nexample, Nãrad and the Sanakãdik all followed the path of nivrutti, \nwhereas the Sapta Rushis, and Janak Rãjã, all followed the path of \npravrutti.  However, due to their nishchay in Bhagvãn, they should all \nbe known to be nirgun. \n \n14.5 “However, those who follow the path of nivrutti, but do not have \nnishchay in Bhagvãn, should be known to be sagun due to their mãyik \nqualities.  Furthermore, a person should realise, ‘This person appears \nto be a strict tyãgi, but because he does not have the belief of Bhagvãn, \nhe is ignorant and will definitely go to Narak’. \n \n14.6 “On the other hand, a person who has nishchay in Bhagvãn will not \nattain an unpleasant fate – even if some small deficiency remains in \nhim.  In fact, ultimately, he will definitely attain the nirgun state.  But, \na person without this belief of Bhagvãn – even if he is a sincere tyãgi \nand is vigilantly striving to eradicate kãm, krodh, and lobh, – will not \nbe able to eradicate those vicious natures by his efforts alone.  \nUltimately, he will become evil and go to Narak. \n \n14.7 “Therefore, whoever has attained such gnãn of Bhagvãn, even if he \nhas only a weak intellect, should still be regarded as possessing great \nintellect.  On the other hand, if he has not attained such gnãn of \nBhagvãn, then even if he has great intellect, he should still be known \nas having no intellect.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 14 || 147 || \nGADHADÃ II \n- 470 - \nGadhadã II – 15 \nKeeping Hatred Towards The Svabhãvs \n \n15.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Bhãdarvã sud 2 [29th August 1821], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a square cushion \nwhich had been placed on the veranda outside the mandir of Shree \nVãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was \ndressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n15.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked all the paramhans a question:  “There is \na single thought which can destroy any svabhãv, regardless of how \ndifficult it may be.  Without that thought, the svabhãv cannot be \neradicated even if a person were to apply a thousand other thoughts.  \nWhat is that thought?  Please answer according to your \nunderstanding.” \n \n15.3 The paramhans replied according to their understanding, but none \nwere able to give a complete explanation. \n \n15.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “I shall explain.  If a person’s enemy were \nto ruin whatever work he is doing, or if he were to swear at his \nmother or sister, then he would have an intense hatred for him and \nwould employ any means whatsoever to harm him.  If not that, he \nwould at least be extremely happy if someone else were to harm him.  \nIn the very same way, if the inner enemies, such as kãm and krodh, \nobstruct a person while he is striving to attain kalyãn, he would hold \nthe same sort of hatred towards them as well; and that hatred would \nnever diminish.  Whoever applies such a thought can eradicate all \nsvabhãvs with that thought alone. \n15.5 “Now, if a sãdhu were to criticise and insult those inner enemies, then \na person who had the previously mentioned thought would not \ndevelop a hatred towards that sãdhu; he would be grateful to the \nsãdhu and would feel, ‘This sãdhu is helping me conquer my enemy, \nand therefore he is an extremely great friend’.  A person who has \nGADHADÃ II \n- 471 - \nattained such a thought can destroy all of his inner enemies.  As a \nresult, no vicious svabhãvs will be able to remain in his heart.  \nWithout this thought, the inner enemies (svabhãvs) can never be \noverpowered, regardless of whichever types of other thoughts may \nbe applied.  Therefore, keeping hatred towards the svabhãvs is the \ngreatest thought of all.” \n \n15.6 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “By which characteristics can someone \nrecognise a person who would never deflect from the four attributes \nof dharma, vairãgya, gnãn of the ãtmã, and bhakti of Bhagvãn coupled \nwith knowledge of His greatness?” \n \n15.7 All the sãdhus attempted to answer the question according to their \nunderstanding, but no one was able to give a precise answer. \n \n15.8 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “From childhood, if a person has such \na nature that he would never be suppressed by anyone’s personality, \nnor could anyone mock someone or joke in his presence, nor could \nanyone make even a mild sarcastic comment at him, then such a \nperson would never deflect from dharma, vairãgya, gnãn, and the \nbhakti of Bhagvãn.  Even though his personality may make him \nappear arrogant, because of his enthusiasm to attain kalyãn, he will \nnot leave satsang under any circumstances.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 15 || 148 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 16 \nFaith In Bhagvãn And Faith In Dharma \n \n16.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Bhãdarvã sud 10 [7th September 1821], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a wooden bench \nnear the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr \nin Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of \nGADHADÃ II \n- 472 - \nmunis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n16.2 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Some may have nishchay in \nBhagvãn, like Arjun, and others may have nishchay in dharma, like \nYudhishthir.  Of these two, if a person attempts to maintain faith in \nBhagvãn, faith in dharma may decline; and if a person attempts to \nmaintain faith in dharma, faith in Bhagvãn may decline.  So, what \nmethod can a person use so that neither of the two declines?” \n \n16.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The first skandh of Shreemad Bhãgvat \nincludes a discussion between Pruthvi and Dharma, which mentions \nthat Bhagvãn possesses the thirty-nine kalyãn-kãri characteristics, \nsuch as truthfulness and purity.  Therefore, all forms of dharma are \nsupported by the murti of Bhagvãn.  This is why Bhagvãn is called \ndharma-dhurandhar (the upholder of dharma). \n \n16.4 “Also, in the first skandh of the Shreemad Bhãgvat, the Sanakãdik \nrushis ask Sutpurãni, ‘In whom did dharma seek refuge after Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn – who was the shield for dharma – reverted to His \ndhãm?’  Therefore, dharma takes refuge only in Bhagvãn’s murti.  \nThat is why when a person keeps faith in Bhagvãn’s murti, Bhagvãn \ncomes and dwells in that person’s heart.  As a result, dharma also \ndwells in his heart.  Therefore, faith in dharma naturally develops in a \nperson who possesses faith in Bhagvãn.  However, if a person \nmaintains faith in dharma alone, then faith in Bhagvãn will decline.  It \nis for this reason that a person who is intelligent should certainly \nmaintain firm faith in Bhagvãn; and as a result faith in dharma will \nalso remain firm.” \n \n16.5 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked another question:  “Can the desires \nfor the panch-vishays be conquered by vairãgya, or can they be \nconquered by other means?” \n \nGADHADÃ II \n- 473 - \n16.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “Whether or not a person has vairãgya, if \nhe attentively follows the niyams prescribed by Bhagvãn, then the \ndesires for the panch-vishays can be conquered. \n \n16.7 “With vairãgya, a great deal of effort is required to withdraw a \nperson’s vrutti from sounds; and even then, the ears can still hear.  \nHowever, if the ears are simply plugged, then naturally no sound will \nbe heard.  Similarly, if a person does not touch anything \ninappropriate, he automatically conquers touch.  In the same way, if \nhe does not look at anything improper, he automatically conquers \nsight.  Also, when there is delicious food, if he mixes it together and \nadds water to it, and he controls his diet, then the sense of taste will \nautomatically be conquered.  If he blocks his nose when there is an \nattractive smell, he also automatically conquers the sense of smell.  In \nthis way, the panch-vishays can be conquered by following niyams.  \nHowever, if a person does not follow these niyams, then regardless of \nhow intense his vairãgya may be, or how much gnãn he may possess, \nhe will not remain stable in any way.  Therefore, the only way to \novercome the desires for the panch-vishays is to follow the niyams \nprescribed by Bhagvãn.  Furthermore, for those who have little \nvairãgya, remaining within niyams is the only way of being saved, just \nas an ill person can only be cured if he controls his diet and \ncompletes his course of medication.” \n \n16.8 Then, Akhandãnand Swãmi asked, “An ill person has a fixed number \nof days over which he must follow his course of medication.  \nSimilarly, is there a definite time period for which a person must \nmake an effort to attain kalyãn?” \n \n16.9 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “It takes a person who has weak shraddhã \nmany lives to reach the highest point of his spiritual activities.  In \nfact, the Bhagvad Geetã states: \n \nanek-janma-sansiddh-stato yãti parãm gatim \n \nGADHADÃ II \n- 474 - \n \n“This shlok explains that only a yogi who has become siddh after \nmany lives, attains Akshardhãm.  This has been said for those who \nhave less shraddhã. \n \n16.10 “In comparison, a person who has strong shraddhã becomes \nenlightened immediately.  This is also mentioned in the Bhagvad \nGeetã: \n \n \nshraddhãvan-labhate gnãnam tat-paraha sanyatendriyaha \ngnãnam labdhvã parãm shãntima-chirenã-dhigach-chhati \n \n \n \n“The meaning of this shlok is, ‘A person whose indriyas are under \ncontrol and who also possesses shraddhã, attains gnãn.  Upon attaining \nthat gnãn, such a person immediately attains Akshardhãm’.  Therefore, \na person who has intense shraddhã reaches the highest point of his \nspiritual activities sooner, whereas a person who has weak shraddhã \nreaches that state after many lives.  For example, if a man is going to \nKãshi, but walks only two steps throughout day, it will obviously take \nhim many days to reach Kãshi.  On the other hand, if he starts \nwalking twenty miles a day, it will take him only a few days to reach \nKãshi.  In the same way, if a person has intense shraddhã, then even if \nhe has only recently become a satsangi, he will still become great.  \nConversely, a person who has little shraddhã, even though he may \nhave joined satsang a long time ago, still remains weak.” \n \n16.11 Then, Shree Gurucharanratãnand Swãmi asked, “If those who have \nless shraddhã attain kalyãn after many lives, where do they stay until \nthen?” \n \n16.12 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “They go and reside in the beautiful loks of \nthe devs.  This is because when that bhakta performed dhyãn on \nBhagvãn, he used to look towards Bhagvãn, and Bhagvãn used to look \ntowards him as well.  However, Bhagvãn was aware of the vishays the \nbhakta thought about and had affection for while performing dhyãn \non Him.  Therefore, when the bhakta leaves his body, Bhagvãn sends \nGADHADÃ II \n- 475 - \nhim to a lok full of the vishays for which he had a passion.  Bhagvãn \nalso issues the following command to Kãl:  ‘You should not interfere in \nthis bhakta’s indulgence in the vishays’.  As a result, that bhakta \nremains in the loks of the devs and enjoys those pleasures.  Then, \nwhen he returns to Mrutyu-Lok, he eventually attains kalyãn after \nmany lives.” \n \n16.13 Akhandãnand Swãmi then asked another question:  “What are the \ncharacteristics of a person who possesses intense shraddhã?” \n \n16.14 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Whenever a person with intense shraddhã \nwants to engage in an activity related to Bhagvãn – such as going for \nthe darshan of Bhagvãn, or listening to talks and kathãs related to \nBhagvãn, or performing His mãnsi pujã – then to be able to do so, he \nwould become very quick in carrying out his bodily activities, such as \nbathing.  Also, if I were to write a letter changing a particular \nvartmãn, he would be eager to abide by it.  In addition, even if he \nwere a senior person, he would become as impatient as a child to \nhave the darshan of Bhagvãn.  A person who has such characteristics \nshould be known as a person who possesses intense shraddhã. \n \n16.15 “A person who has such shraddhã is able to immediately conquer all \nof his indriyas.  However, the indriyas of a person, who has little \nshraddhã on the path of Bhagvãn, are extremely attached to the \nvishays.  Moreover, no matter how hard he tries to hide it, everyone \nstill realises the fact that this person’s indriyas are extremely \nattached towards the vishays.” \n \n16.16 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The indriyas are like the wind – \neven though the wind cannot be seen, it can be assumed that the \nwind is blowing by the way in which it shakes the trees.  Similarly, \nthe vruttis of the indriyas cannot be seen, but everyone realises that \nthey flow towards the vishays.  If a person deceitfully attempts to \nhide this, then realising him to be deceitful, others will criticise him \nGADHADÃ II \n- 476 - \neven more.  Therefore, in no way can a person conceal that intense \ncraving of his indriyas to indulge in the vishays.” \n \n16.17 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “How can those intense cravings of \nthe indriyas to indulge in the vishays be eradicated?” \n \n16.18 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The only means to eradicate the intensity of \nthe indriyas is to force the indriyas to follow the niyams for tyãgis and \ngrahasthas as prescribed by Bhagvãn.  As a result, the intensity of the \nindriyas automatically diminishes.  When a person does not allow the \nfive indriyas (the ears, the skin, the eyes, the tongue, and the nose) to \nwander, the diet of the indriyas becomes pure, after which the antah-\nkarans become pure as well.  Therefore, regardless of whether a \nperson possesses intense vairãgya or not, if he conquers his indriyas \nand keeps them within the niyams prescribed by Bhagvãn, he can \nconquer the desires for the vishays more thoroughly than a person \nwith intense vairãgya.  Therefore, a person should firmly abide by the \nniyams prescribed by Bhagvãn.” \n \n16.19 Akhandãnand Swãmi asked again, “If a person has weak shraddhã, \nhow can it become stronger?” \n \n16.20 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a person can realise the greatness of \nBhagvãn then even if he has weak shraddhã, it will grow stronger.  \nFor example, a person would never be attracted to clay utensils that \nare used for drinking water.  However, if those utensils were made of \ngold, then he would naturally be attracted to them.  Similarly, if he \nrealises the greatness of the talks and kirtans related to Bhagvãn, \nthen his shraddhã in Bhagvãn and in those activities will naturally \nincrease.  Therefore, a person should use whichever method is \nnecessary to understand the greatness of Bhagvãn.  If he does use \nsuch a method, then even if he has no shraddhã at all, he will develop \nshraddhã; and if he has weak shraddhã, it will become stronger.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 16 || 149 || \nGADHADÃ II \n- 477 - \nGadhadã II – 17 \nTattvas In The Svarup Of Bhagvãn \nSthitapragna \n \n17.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on the night of Ãso vad 11 [21st October \n1821], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a sinhãsan \non the veranda outside the rooms near the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-\nNãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  Two torches were lit in front of Him.  While \nkirtans were being sung, a sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n17.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please stop the kirtans now, and let us \nbegin a question-answer discussion.” \n \n17.3 Then, all the munis replied, “Very well, Mahãrãj.” \n \n17.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then raised a question:  “Some bhaktas understand \nthe svarup of Bhagvãn as being composed of the twenty-four tattvas \nof Mãyã, while some understand it as being composed purely of \nchaitanya and free of mãyik elements.  Of these two types of bhaktas, \nwhose understanding is correct, and whose understanding is \nincorrect?” \n \n17.5 Muktãnand Swãmi replied, “The understanding of a person who \nconsiders Bhagvãn’s svarup as being composed of the twenty-four \nmãyik elements is incorrect.  The understanding of a person who \nconsiders Bhagvãn’s svarup as being composed purely of chaitanya, \nand free of mãyik tattvas, is correct.” \n \n17.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Followers of the Sãnkhya philosophy \nclaim that there are twenty-four tattvas.  According to that \nphilosophy, there are twenty-three tattvas, and the twenty-fourth is \nkshetragna – in the form of jeev and ishvar – which is composed of \nGADHADÃ II \n- 478 - \nchaitanya.  The twenty-four tattva have been described in this way.  \nThis is because kshetra and kshetragna have a mutual dependence on \neach other.  Without kshetragna, kshetra cannot be described, and \nwithout kshetra, kshetragna cannot be described.  For this reason, \njeev and ishvar have been included with the elements, while Bhagvãn \nhas been described as the refuge of both kshetra and kshetragna.  In \nthis case, how can the mãyik tattvas be described as being distinct \nfrom Bhagvãn?  For example, four tattvas reside within ãkãsh, yet \nãkãsh is unaffected by any of their flaws.  In the same way, not a \nsingle flaw of the mãyik tattvas influences the svarup of Bhagvãn.  So, \nwhat is the inconsistency in believing that Bhagvãn’s svarup is \ncomposed of the twenty-four tattvas?  Does claiming ‘Bhagvãn’s \nsvarup is not composed of the tattvas’ prevent inconsistencies?  This is \nhow I understand it.” \n \n17.7 Then, Dinã-Nãth Bhatt asked, “Should a person who wishes to \nperform dhyãn on Bhagvãn’s svarup understand it as being composed \nof the tattvas or understand it as not being composed of the tattvas?” \n \n17.8 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person who understands Bhagvãn’s \nsvarup as being composed of the tattvas, is a sinner; and a person \nwho understands Bhagvãn’s svarup as not being composed of the \ntattvas is also a sinner.  Those who are bhaktas of Bhagvãn do not at \nall like to senselessly quibble over whether or not Bhagvãn’s svarup \nis composed of the tattvas.  A bhaktas realises, ‘Bhagvãn is Bhagvãn.  \nThere is no scope for dividing or discarding any part of Him.  That very \nBhagvãn is the ãtmã of countless brahmãnds’.  A person who has no \ndoubts at all regarding the nature of Bhagvãn should be known to \nhave attained the nirvikalp state.  A person with such stable \nunderstanding should be known as ‘sthitapragna’.  Moreover, \nBhagvãn redeems all the sins of a person who has such stable \nunderstanding regarding Bhagvãn. \n \n17.9 “In the Bhagvad Geetã, Bhagvãn has said to Arjun, \nGADHADÃ II \n- 479 - \n \nsarva-dharman-parityajya mãme-kam sharanam vraja \naham tvam sarva-pãpebhyo mokshayi-shyãmi mã shuchaha \nAbandon all other forms of dharma and surrender only unto me. \nI shall deliver you from all sins; so do not grieve. \n \n17.10 “In fact, it is a usual custom in this world that an intelligent person \nwill not notice a fault in someone who serves his major self-interests.  \nFor example, to serve her self-interest, a woman will not notice any \nfaults in her husband.  This also applies to other grahasthas who do \nnot notice the faults in their relatives, if they have intense self-\ninterest in them.  In the same way, if a person realises that Bhagvãn \nserves his own self-interest – Bhagvãn relieves His bhaktas of their \nsins and ignorance and grants them kalyãn – then he will never \nperceive avgun in Bhagvãn in any way. \n \n17.11 “For example, when Shukji narrated the rãs-leelã, Parikshit Rãjã \nraised the following doubt:  ‘Why did Bhagvãn associate with other \nwomen?’  However, Shukji did not have the slightest doubt.  Even the \ngopis, with whom Bhagvãn engaged in romantic actions, did not \ndoubt by thinking, ‘If He is Bhagvãn, why does He behave like this?’  \nThey did not have any such doubts.  Moreover, when Bhagvãn went \nto the home of Kubjã, He took Uddhavji along with Him, yet Uddhavji \ndid not have any doubts at all.  Also, when Uddhavji was sent to Vraj, \nhe still did not have any doubts on hearing the words of the gopis.  \nInstead, he greatly realised the greatness of the gopis. \n \n17.12 “Therefore, the understanding of a person who has developed an \nunwavering refuge of Bhagvãn will not become distorted, regardless \nof whether he is very educated in the shãstras, or he is naïve.  Also, \nthe greatness of a loyal bhakta of Bhagvãn can only be realised by a \nperson who is a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  Regardless of whether a person \nis educated in the shãstras or is naïve, only a person with a firm \nunderstanding of Bhagvãn realises the greatness of a bhakta of \nBhagvãn, and only he recognises a bhakta possessing a firm \nGADHADÃ II \n- 480 - \nunderstanding.  On the other hand, vimukhs in the world, regardless \nof whether they are pandits or fools, are unable to develop such firm \nunderstanding of Bhagvãn.  Moreover, they do not recognise a bhakta \npossessing a firm understanding, and nor do they realise the \ngreatness of a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  Therefore, only a bhakta of \nBhagvãn can recognise another bhakta of Bhagvãn, and only he can \nrealise his greatness.  For example, Uddhavji realised the profound \ngreatness of the gopis.  Likewise, the gopis realised the greatness of \nUddhavji. \n \n17.13 “Although Purushottam Bhagvãn is the kshetragna of all kshetragnas, \nHe is still not subject to change.  Moreover, the disturbances of \nobjects that cause disturbances – such as Mãyã – do not influence \nPurushottam Bhagvãn.  In fact, if the disturbances of sthul, sukshma, \nand kãran do not influence a person who has realised the ãtmã, what \ncan be said about them not influencing Purushottam Bhagvãn?  \nTherefore, Bhagvãn is certainly not subject to change; He is \nabsolutely unaffected. \n \n17.14 “A bhakta of Bhagvãn who understands Bhagvãn’s svarup in this way \nshould be known to be ‘sthitapragna’.  Just as a person who has \nrealised his ãtmã is called ‘sthitapragna’, a bhakta of Bhagvãn who \nhas no doubts at all regarding the svarup of Bhagvãn, and glorifies His \nstrengths, is also called ‘sthitapragna’.  He also glorifies those \ncharitras of Bhagvãn that appear to be inappropriate, in exactly the \nsame way that he glorifies charitras that are appropriate – without \nhaving any doubts about the appropriateness or inappropriateness of \nthose charitras.  Such a bhakta should be known as being \n‘sthitapragna’ with regards to the nature of Purushottam.  A person \nwho has developed such a firm belief of the nature of Purushottam \nhas nothing more left to understand.” \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 17 || 150 || \n \n \nGADHADÃ II \n- 481 - \nGadhadã II – 18 \nNãstik And Shushka-Vedãnti \n \n18.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Mãgshar vad 6 [7th December 1821], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \nlarge, cylindrical pillow that had been placed in His residence in Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes, and had \ncovered Himself with a white chãdar, over which He had wrapped a \nrichly embroidered rajãi.  He had also tied a white feto around His \nhead.  At that time, Prãgji Davé was reading a shãstra before Him, and \na sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n18.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Having thought over it from all aspects, I \nhave come to the following conclusion: Of all the kusang in the world, \nthe kusang which is worse than all others is that of those who do not \nhave bhakti towards Bhagvãn.  Also, they do not have the faith in \ntheir hearts that Bhagvãn loves His bhaktas, is the lord of all, is patit-\npãvan, and is also adham-udhãran.  In this world, two thoughts share \nthese beliefs:  One is that of the nãstiks, and the other is that of the \nshushka-vedãntis.  Both are extreme forms of kusang.  Now, even if a \nperson has committed the five great sins, but he has faith in Bhagvãn, \nthen at some time or another he will be redeemed.  In fact, even if a \nperson has committed the great sins of killing a child, slaughtering a \ncow, or killing a woman, then he too can be redeemed at some point \nin time.  However, a person who has come to accept either of these \ntwo sets of beliefs will never be redeemed.  This is because such a \nperson’s understanding is contrary to that of the Veds, the six-\nshãstras, and the Purãns. \n \n18.3 “Of the two, the nãstiks believe that Rãmchandraji and Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn were actually only kings; and because Shree Krishna killed \ndemons and committed adultery, he has been sent to the third Narak.  \nTherefore, in no way do they consider Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, who is \nGADHADÃ II \n- 482 - \npatit-pãvan and adham-udhãran, as being Bhagvãn.  Instead, they \nbelieve their kalyãn to be through karmas.  They believe that while \nperforming karmas, they attain keval-gnãn, and become Bhagvãn.  In \nthis way, they believe that there are countless Bhagvãns.  So, \naccording to the belief of the nãstiks, there is no one, eternal Bhagvãn, \nby whose worship a jeev is released from the bondage of births and \ndeaths.  Therefore, that belief is not in accordance with the Veds. \n \n18.4 “The shushka-vedãntis believe that brahm itself has assumed the \nsvarup of the jeevs – just as in the relationship between the sun and \nits reflection.  Therefore, when a person realises ‘I am brahm’, he has \nno further spiritual activities left to perform.  Then, when he has \nbecome Bhagvãn, he does not need to worship anyone.  Thinking this, \nthey no longer have fear in committing sins.  Moreover, they believe, \n‘We have attained the nirgun path, so we will not have to take birth \nagain’.  However, the shushka-vedãntis do not examine their own \nunderstanding which implies that nirgun brahm, which is beyond \nMãyã, will also have to pass through births and deaths.  This is \nbecause they claim that brahm itself has assumed the svarup of all \nsthãvar and jangam objects.  This means that just as a jeev has to \nundergo births and deaths, brahm also has to undergo births and \ndeaths.  Also, while they think, ‘We will be released from births and \ndeaths’, they do not realise, ‘According to our own beliefs, births and \ndeaths have become a reality for brahm itself.  Therefore, if we do \ndevelop deep understanding, at most we shall realise ourselves to be \nbrahm-svarup.  But even then, the cycle of births and deaths will still \nnot be dispelled’.  As a result, by their own beliefs, moksh is proven \nfalse.  Nevertheless, no one examines this.  Instead, they boast, ‘We \nare brahm-svarup, so who do we need to worship?  Who do we bow to?’  \nThinking this, they become extremely arrogant.  Even though they \nhave not truly understood anything, they still have pride of their \ngnãn.  However, they do not realise that their own moksh is proven \nfalse by their own beliefs.  Moreover, they convert those who keep \ntheir company into fools as well. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 483 - \n18.5 “However, bhaktas possessing true gnãn, such as Nãrad, the \nSanakãdik, and Shukji, constantly perform dhyãn upon Bhagvãn, \nchant His holy name, and sing kirtans.  Even the niranna-muktas in \nShvet-Dvip, who are brahm-svarup and who can control Kãl, \ncontinuously perform dhyãn upon Bhagvãn, chant His holy name, and \nsing kirtans about Him.  They also offer pujã, smear sandalwood \npaste on Him, and perform dandvats.  Despite being akshar-rup, they \nbehave as the dãs of Purushottam Bhagvãn.  Also, the residents of \nBadrikãshram, including Uddhav, Tanu Rushi, and the other munis, \nperform tap and continuously offer bhakti to Bhagvãn.  On the other \nhand, the shushka-vedãntis are completely oriented around their \nbodies.  Also, they do not perform dhyãn upon Bhagvãn, nor do they \nchant the name of Bhagvãn, and nor do they bow before Bhagvãn.  \nCompared to the power and gnãn of Nãrad, the Sanakãdik, and \nShukji; and compared to the power and gnãn of the niranna-muktas \nwho reside in Shvet-Dvip; and compared to the power and gnãn of \nthe rushis who reside in Badrikãshram, these shushka-vedãntis do not \npossess even a millionth of a fraction of such power and gnãn.  \nNevertheless, they equate themselves with Bhagvãn.  Therefore, they \nare absolutely ignorant.  In fact, they are the most ignorant of all \nignorant people.  Even after spending countless millions of years in \nthe pits of Narak suffering the torments of Yam, they will still not be \nreleased. \n \n18.6 “Therefore, to associate with such people is the very definition of \nkusang.  Just as there is no deed greater than keeping the company of \nthe sat-purush, conversely, there is no sin worse than keeping the \ncompany of ignorant people such as the shushka-vedãntis.  Therefore, \na person who desires moksh should in no way keep the company of a \nnãstik or a shushka-vedãnti.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 18 || 151 || \n \n \nGADHADÃ II \n- 484 - \nGadhadã II – 19 \nDistress After Hearing Shushka-Vedãnti Shãstras \nLetter To The Haribhaktas \n \n19.1 In the Samvat year 1878, at daybreak on Mãgshar vad 14 [23rd \nDecember 1821], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj arrived at the \nresidential hall of the paramhans in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  In an unhappy mood, He sat down on a mattress with a \nlarge, cylindrical pillow.  He refused to talk to anyone, or even look at \nanyone.  The white feto tied around His head had loosened and \nbecome undone, yet He paid no attention to it.  In this way, He sat \nextremely unhappy for a while.  Tears then begun to flow from His \neyes. \n \n19.2 Then, addressing the paramhans, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “To learn \nabout the beliefs of those possessing shushka-gnãn, I listened to their \nshãstras.  However, simply hearing them has caused much grief in my \nheart.  This is because by listening to the shushka-vedãnti shãstras, \nthe upãsanã of Bhagvãn is dispelled from the mind, and a sense of \nequality arises in a person’s heart, and he begins to worship devs.  By \nlistening to the words of those shushka-vedãntis, a person’s mind \nbecomes extremely corrupted.  Even though I listened to the \nprinciples of shushka-vedãnti with a specific purpose, doing so has \nbrought me much grief.” \n \n19.3 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj became very unhappy, and sat in \nsilence with His heart filled with sorrow.  After remaining \ndisheartened for a long time, He wiped the tears from His eyes with \nHis hands and said, “I went to sleep last night after listening to \nRãmãnuj’s commentary on the Bhagvad Geetã.  I had a dream in \nwhich I went to Golok, where I saw countless pãrshads of Bhagvãn.  \nOf these, some serve Bhagvãn, and they appear to be very still.  \nOthers sing kirtans of Bhagvãn, including kirtans composed by \nMuktãnand Swãmi and Brahmãnand Swãmi.  In the process of \nsinging kirtans, they sway in the same way as a person who sings and \nGADHADÃ II \n- 485 - \nsways in euphoria due to intoxication.  Then, I also joined those who \nwere singing and began to sing kirtans.  While singing, the following \nthought arose:  ‘A person who shuns such loving bhakti and upãsanã of \nBhagvãn, and claims to possess gnãn, and believes, ‘I myself am \nBhagvãn’, is extremely wicked’.” \n \n19.4 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Let us write a letter to send to \nthe satsangis in various places so that they never lapse in observing \ndharma and in offering bhakti to Bhagvãn in any way, and so that \ntheir mind is never dislodged from this ishta-dev, Shree Krishna-\nNãrãyan. \n \n19.5 “‘Written by Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj.  All paramhans and \nall satsangis – male and female – please accept sincerest ‘Nãrãyan’ \nfrom me.  I am issuing the following as my ãgnã:  The avatãr of Shree \nKrishna-Nãrãyan – Purushottam Bhagvãn – incarnates among humans \nand devs, for the purpose of establishing dharma, uprooting adharma, \nand giving darshan to and protecting His ekãntik bhaktas who possess \nthe four qualities (dharma in the form of brahm-chãrya and ahinsã, \nãtmã-nisthã, vairãgya, and bhakti coupled with the knowledge of \nBhagvãn’s greatness).  Therefore, a person should have a singular \nbelief of that avatãr – just as Sitãji was convinced that Rãmchandraji \nwas flawless.  A person should also lovingly perform the mãnsi pujã of \nthat Bhagvãn and physically offer to Him the nine types of bhakti.  If \nthat avatãr of Shree Krishna-Nãrãyan is not present on this earth, then \nhe should perform pujã of His murti mentally and also physically by \noffering sandalwood paste, tulsi, flowers, and other similar offerings. \n \n19.6 “Moreover, he should offer upãsanã only to Bhagvãn and not to any \ndev; if he does, it is a great sin.  In this way, his vow of fidelity is lost and \nhis bhakti becomes like that of a prostitute.  Therefore, a person should \noffer bhakti to Bhagvãn in the way of Sitã and Rukmani.  He should \nperform dhyãn only on that Bhagvãn and not on any dev, and nor \nshould he perform dhyãn on a sãdhu, even if he has attained an \nelevated state and mastered samãdhi. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 486 - \n19.7 “Furthermore, all should strictly abide by the dharma of their varna \nand ãshram.  All men who firmly abide by this ãgnã of mine will \ndevelop firm bhakti towards Shree Krishna Nãrãyan like that of Nãrad.  \nAll women who accept this injunction of mine will develop firm bhakti \ntowards Shree Krishna-Nãrãyan, like that of Lakshmiji and the gopis, \nsuch as Rãdhikãji.  Conversely, the bhakti of those who do not accept \nthese words of mine will become like that of a prostitute. \n \n19.8 “Written on Mãgshar vad 14, Samvat 1878’.” \n \n19.9 After writing this letter, Shreeji Mahãrãj had it sent to all satsangis \nresiding in various places. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 19 || 152 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 20 \nThe Sense Of Knowing And The Strength Of the Indriyas \n \n20.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Posh vad 14 [22nd January 1822], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in front of the mandir of \nShree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white \nchofãl, above which He Had wrapped a rajãi made of chhint.  He had \nalso tied a white pãgh around His head.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.  Some of \nthe paramhans were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a \nmrudang.   \n \n20.2 Then, addressing the paramhans, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “At my \nresidence today, I asked a question to Somlã Khãchar and the other \nbhaktas who stay with me.  I would like all the paramhans to get \ntogether and answer that question.” \n \n20.3 The paramhans requested, “Mahãrãj, may we please hear that \nquestion.” \nGADHADÃ II \n- 487 - \n20.4 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A person who masters samãdhi attains a \nspiritual state that is beyond mãyã.  He also has firm bond with the \nsvarup of Bhagvãn.  Therefore, the person’s mental ability, as well as \nthe strength of his body and indriyas, should increase.  This is \nbecause the twenty-four tattvas, which have been produced from \nMãyã, have a form that is both jad and chaitanya; they cannot be said \nto be only jad, nor can they be said to be only chaitanya.  Also, the \nstrength in each of the elements cannot be said to be equal.  There is \na greater degree of awareness in the antah-karans than there is in the \nindriyas.  Likewise, there is a greater degree of awareness in the jeev \n– the drashtã of the indriyas and antah-karans – than there is in the \nantah-karans. \n \n20.5 “When the jeev experiences samãdhi, it abandons its role as the \ndrashtã of the indriyas and antah-karans; and like Brahm, that jeev \nbecomes chaitanya, and its bond with the svarup of Bhagvãn is \nmaintained.  Now, regarding those who have mastered samãdhi, \nsome people think, ‘Whoever experiences samãdhi, loses even the \nknowledge he had previously’.  So, do the mental ability and the \nstrength of the body and indriyas of a person who has mastered \nsamãdhi increase or not?  That is the question.” \n \n20.6 The paramhans then answered according to their intellect, but no \none was able to give an adequate answer to Shreeji Mahãrãj’s \nquestion. \n \n20.7 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “I will answer.  The answer to the \nquestion is that Brahm, who is the witness, enters the brahmãnd – \nwhich is composed of the twenty-four tattvas, and which was \nproduced from Mãyã – and makes it chaitanya.  This gives it the \npower to perform all activities.  The nature of that Brahm is such that \nwhen it enters an object that is as jad as wood or stone, that object \nbecomes an object that can move.  When the jeev becomes one with \nthat Brahm through samãdhi, then that jeev can also be said to be \nbrahm-rup.  As a result, its gnãn also increases. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 488 - \n20.8 “With regards to the strength of the indriyas, a person who practices \nyog, coupled with tap, nivrutti dharma, and vairãgya, attains siddh-\ndashã like that of Shukji.  On the other hand, there may be a person \nwhose tap, observance of nivrutti dharma, and vairãgya are at an \nordinary level, and who follows the path of pravrutti in the form of \ndharma, arth, and kãm.  In his case, although he may experience \nsamãdhi, only his gnãn will increase, but the strength of his indriyas \ndoes not increase and he does not attain siddh-dashã.  In fact, even \nthough a person may possess gnãn like Janak Rãjã, those who follow \nthe path of pravrutti do not attain siddh-dashã like Nãrad, the \nSanakãdik, and Shukji.  On the other hand, a person who has attained \nsiddh-dashã can travel to all places in this lok and beyond.  However, \nfor those who follow the path of pravrutti, like Janak Rãjã, only their \ngnãn increases; but it does not decrease. \n \n20.9 “In fact, what happens is described by Shree Krishna Bhagvãn in the \nGeetã in the shlok: \n \nyã nishã sarva-bhootãnãm tasyãm jãgarti sayyamee \nyasyãm jãgrati bhootãni sã nishã pashyato munehe \n \n \n“The meaning of this shlok is:  ‘A self-controlled person is awake to \nthat which all other beings are asleep; and that to which all other \nbeings are awake, a self-controlled person is asleep’. Specifically, a \nperson whose vision is facing inwards towards the ãtmã has no \nregard to his body, indriyas, or antah-karans.  On seeing this, a person \nwho is ignorant thinks, ‘The gnãn of a person who experiences \nsamãdhi decreases’.  As a result, if a person under the influence of \nrajo-gun, tamo-gun, or impure sattva-gun attempts to answer this \nquestion, then he would certainly think that the gnãn of a person who \nexperiences samãdhi does decrease.  However, he does not realise, ‘I \nconstantly believe myself to be the body and am speaking out of \nfoolishness’. \n \n20.10 “Therefore, the gnãn of a person who experiences samãdhi still \nincreases even though he behaves distinctly from the body, indriyas, \nGADHADÃ II \n- 489 - \nand antah-karans.  Even after he returns to the indriyas and antah-\nkarans, the gnãn obtained during samãdhi is still not destroyed.  As \nfor a person who takes up tap, nivrutti dharma, and vairãgya – after \nabandoning the path of pravrutti – just as his gnãn has increased, the \nstrength of his indriyas and antah-karans will increase as well.  Also, \nhe will attain siddh-dashã like Nãrad, the Sanakãdik, and Shukji.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 20 || 153 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 21 \nBhagvãn Is The Cause Of All \n \n21.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Fãgan sud Punam [7th March 1822], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in front of the mandir \nof Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white \nchãdar.  He had also tied a white pãgh around His head.  Premãnand \nSwãmi and other paramhans were singing vishnupad before Him. \n \n21.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please stop the kirtans.  I wish to speak \nto all of you, so please listen attentively.”  He then said, “I have \nlistened to all the shãstras written by Vyãsji regarding the attainment \nof kalyãn.  The main principle prevalent in all those shãstras and the \nonly principle for the kalyãn of the jeev is simply this:  Bhagvãn \ncreates, maintains, and destroys this entire universe. \n \n21.3 “Also, in all of those shãstras, there are talks of the charitras of either \nBhagvãn or His sant.  So, a person cannot attain kalyãn just by \nfollowing the dharma of his varna and ashram, or through its rewards \nin the form of dharma, arth, and kãm.  This is because the observance \nof the dharma on its own may bring worldly reputation and physical \ncomforts – but that is all.  However, to attain kalyãn, a person must \nrealise Bhagvãn to be the all-doer. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 490 - \n21.4 “In addition, nothing remains to be understood on the path of kalyãn \nif a person realises the greatness of pratyaksha Bhagvãn and His sant \nin exactly the same way as he realises the greatness of past avatãrs of \nBhagvãn such as Rãm, and Krishna, and the greatness of past sãdhus, \nsuch as Nãrad, the Sanakãdik, Shukji, Jadbharat, Hanumãn, and \nUddhav. \n \n21.5 “Whether this principle is understood after being told once, or after \nbeing told a thousand times; whether it is understood today, or after \na thousand years, there is no option but to understand it.  If a person \nwere to ask Nãrad, the Sanakãdik, Shukji, Brahma, and Shiv, as they \nare wise, even they would point to pratyaksha Bhagvãn and the \npratyaksha sant as being the only granters of kalyãn.  They would \nalso explain that the greatness of the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvãn \nand the pratyaksha sant is exactly the same as the greatness of past \nsvarup of Bhagvãn and His sant. \n \n21.6 “A person who has such a firm nishchay, has grasped all the \nfundamental principles.  What is more, he will never fall from the \npath of kalyãn.  Brahmã, Shiv, Bruhaspati, Parãshar, and many others \nmay have fallen from the path of dharma due to vicious natures like \nkãm and krodh, but because they had the same nishchay and \nknowledge of the greatness of pratyaksha Bhagvãn and the \npratyaksha sant as they had of their past lives, they did not fall from \nthe path of kalyãn.  Therefore, this very fact is the essence of all the \nshãstras.” \n \n21.7 In the evening of that same day, Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj \nmounted His horse in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã and came to \nLakshmi-Vãdi.  There, He sat on a decorated bedstead on the \nplatform under the mango tree.  He was wearing a white khes and \nhad covered Himself with a white chãdar.  He had also tied a white \npãgh around His head, with a tassel of yellow flowers hanging from it.  \nBunches of mogrã flowers were placed upon His ears, and a garland \nGADHADÃ II \n- 491 - \nof mogrã flowers was hanging around His neck.  A sabhã of munis, as \nwell as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n21.8 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please listen, I wish to ask all of you a \nquestion.  During the svapna state, when the jeev sees a creation and \nindulges in the pleasures of that creation, does the jeev itself become \nthe svarup of the creation?  Or does the jeev create the creation in its \nsvapna by its own will?  Also, in the same way as the jeev, the ishvars \nalso experience creations during their svapna state.  Do they \nthemselves become the svarup of the creation?  Or do they create it \nby their own will?  Or does Bhagvãn, who is beyond both jeev and \nishvar, create the creations experienced in their svapnas?” \n \n21.9 Everyone attempted to answer the question according to his level of \nintelligence, but no one was able to offer a precise explanation. \n \n21.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “Neither the jeev nor ishvar creates \nthe creations experienced during the svapna state, and nor do they \nbecome the svarup of those creations themselves.  In reality, it is \nBhagvãn – who is beyond both jeev and ishvar, and who is also the \ngiver of the rewards of a person’s karmas – who creates the world \nexperienced in svapnas according to the karmas of the particular jeev \nor ishvar. \n \n21.11 “The unstable and deceptive nature of svapnas is due to their region \nof origin.  The throat is a place where countless types of such \ncreations can be seen – just as when an oil lamp is lit in one place \nwithin a mandir decorated with mirrors, countless oil lamps would \nbe seen.  Therefore, due to the location of its origin (the throat), a \nsingle thought can be experienced in countless ways.” \n \n21.12 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “A person possessing gnãn understands \nonly the influence of desh to be predominant when there is the \npredominance of desh; when the influence of kãl is predominant, he \nGADHADÃ II \n- 492 - \nunderstands only kãl to be predominant; when the influence of \nkarma is predominant, he understands only karma to be \npredominant; and when Bhagvãn’s influence is predominant, he \nunderstand only Bhagvãn to be predominant.  In contrast, a fool, once \nhe has understood one factor, considers that alone to be the main \nprinciple.  If he has understood kãl, he considers kãl to be the main \nprinciple; if he has understood karma, he considers karma to be the \nmain principle; and if he has understood mãyã, he considers mãyã to \nbe the main principle.  However, such a fool does not know how to \ndistinguish between the different predominating factors prevalent in \ndifferent circumstances.  On the other hand, a person with gnãn \nunderstands the predominance of various factors based on the \ncircumstances. \n \n21.13 “In fact, it is Bhagvãn who is the inspirer of everything – of desh, kãl, \nkarma, and mãyã.  It is He Himself who allows the factors of desh, kãl, \nkarma, and mãyã, to be predominant.  Therefore, they are all \ndependent upon Bhagvãn – just as the shishumãr chakra is dependent \non the support of the Dhruv star; and just as all the subjects of a \nkingdom are dependent on their king.  Furthermore, in a kingdom, \nthe minister and secretaries can only do as much as their king allows \nthem to do; when the king does not allow it, they cannot do even the \nsmallest of tasks.  In the same way, the factors of desh, kãl, karma, \nand mãyã can only do as much as Bhagvãn allows them to do; they \ncannot do a single thing against the wish of Bhagvãn.  Therefore, only \nBhagvãn is the all-doer.” \n \n21.14 After delivering this talk, Shreeji Mahãrãj returned to the darbãr. \n \n21.15 Later that night, Shreeji Mahãrãj went to the residence of the sãdhus.  \nAll the sãdhus bowed down to Him and paid their respects.  Shreeji \nMahãrãj then said to the munis, “I have had a thought, which is why I \nhave come to you at this hour.  In my mind, I understand that \nGADHADÃ II \n- 493 - \nwhoever owns land and money, is the most unhappy; and whoever \nhas very little money and no land, is the most happy.  \n \n21.16 “I have built a mandir in Amdãvãd Nagar, and others will also be \nbuilt.  However, a person should not unwilling donate money to for \nmandirs to be built.  It is the wish of Shree Nar-Nãrãyan if the mandir \nis built or not.  However, we should do whatever does not cause \nproblems for the mandir. \n \n21.17 “Some festivals, like Janamãshtmi, are celebrated using millions of \nrupees, due to the grace of Shree Nar-Nãrãyan.  Sometimes, festivals \nare celebrated using a tulsi leaf.  The best way is whatever occurs \nwithout difficulty.  However, a person should never ask for money for \nthe mandir.  Due to a person’s shraddhã in Shree Nar-Nãrãyan, if they \nwish to donate their land, they should do so willingly.  A person \nshould not forcefully ask for anything.” \n \n21.18 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj happily asked the sãdhu a question, “Who do \nwe call an ekãntik bhakta?” \n \n21.19 Muktãnand Swãmi tried to answer the question, but was unable to \ngive a satisfactory answer. \n \n21.20 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A true ekãntik bhakta sees himself as \nbrahm-rup, who strictly follows his own dharma and performs \nbhakti, regularly performs dhyãn and smaran of Bhagvãn, and also \nkeeps upãsanã of Bhagvãn.  He makes sure that there are no \nalterations in the vartmãns followed by the body, which have been \ngiven by Bhagvãn.  A person with all these qualities should be \nregarded as an ekãntik bhakta. \n \n21.21 “Also, when there is a lack of bhakti on earth, bhakti remains within \nNar-Nãrãyan.  Shree Nar-Nãrãyan behaves just like the ekãntik \nbhakta to teach the bhaktas who come to His feet.  Ekãntik bhaktas \nGADHADÃ II \n- 494 - \nlike this are only found in satsang.  In other sects, there is upãsanã of \nBhagvãn, but there is no tyãg and ãtmã-gnãn; in some sects there is \nãtmã-gnãn, but no upãsanã and tyãg; in some sects there is tyãg, but \nno upãsanã and ãtmã-gnãn.  However, at this time in our satsang, \nthere are many bhaktas with all these qualities.”   \n \n21.22 After deliviering this talk, Shreeji Mahãrãj returned to His residence. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 21 || 154 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 22 \nTwo Armies \nThe Installation Of Nar-Nãrãyan Dev  \n \n22.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Fãgan vad 10 [19th March 1822], Shreeji \nMahãrãj awoke in the middle of the night and sat facing south on a \ndecorated bedstead in front of the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan \nin Dãdã Khãchar's darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in \nwhite clothes.  He called all the sãdhus and haribhaktas together, and \nso they gathered before Him in a sabhã. \n \n22.2 Addressing the sãdhus, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “I wish to talk, so please \nlisten.  When two armies are prepared for combat and both have \nimplanted their flags opposite each other, in their minds both feel, \n‘We will capture their flag and shall raise our own in its place’.  \nHowever, they never think, ‘Along the way to the enemy’s flag many \nheads will roll, and rivers of blood will flow’.  In this way, they are \nnever afraid.  This is because those who are brave are not afraid of \ndying.  However, a coward has thousands of thoughts of fleeing.  He \nalso thinks, ‘If our army wins, we shall steal the wealth and weapons of \nour opponents’.  In comparison, the brave soldiers of both kings are \nnot afraid of dying, and nor do they have greedy motives to steal.  \nInstead, they have only one desire – to capture the opponent’s flag \nand ensure their own victory.   \nGADHADÃ II \n- 495 - \n22.3 “Now, in this example, the flag represents the dhãm of Bhagvãn, and \nthe brave soldiers of the kings represent that loyal bhaktas of \nBhagvãn.  Regardless of whether they encounter honours or insults \nin this world; regardless of whether they encounter bodily comforts \nor miseries; regardless of whether their bodies remain healthy or \nunhealthy; and regardless of whether their bodies survive or die, \nloyal bhaktas of Bhagvãn never have weak thoughts such as, ‘We will \nsuffer this much pain’, or ‘We will enjoy this much happiness’.  Neither \nof these two types of thoughts arise within their minds.  Such bhaktas \nfirmly believe, ‘We want to attain the dhãm of Bhagvãn within this \nvery lifetime; we do not want to become tempt by anything along the \nway’. \n \n22.4 “On the other hand, a bhakta of Bhagvãn who identifies himself with \nthe body is represented by the coward soldiers.  While worshipping \nBhagvãn, he has thousands of weak thoughts such as, ‘If the vartmãn \nbecome strict, I will not be able to survive; only if they are easy to \nfollow will I be able to survive’.  He also thinks, ‘If I employ this method, \nI shall be happy even in worldly life.  Also, if it is possible, I shall survive \npassively in satsang’.  Such a bhakta represents the coward.  However, \na loyal and brave bhakta of Bhagvãn never has any types of desires \nrelated to the body or the world.” \n \n22.5 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj then began to narrate an experience \nof His own.  “When I went to Amdãvãd to install the murti of Shree \nNar-Nãrãyan Dev, thousands of people gathered for the festival.  \nFollowing the completion of the installation of Shree Nar-Nãrãyan \nDev, and after thousands of brãhmans from Amdãvãd had been fed, I \ndeparted from there and spent the night in Jetalpur.  There, I began to \nthink, ‘I want to forget all memories of all of those people and all the \nactivities I saw’.  In doing this, I felt intense grief in my heart.  As a \nresult, I became ill.  From there, I went to Dholkã, where I spent the \nnight.  Then, walking from Dholkã with the same thought in mind, I \nreached the forest of Ganesh Dholkã near the village of Koth and \nGADHADÃ II \n- 496 - \nspent the night there.  I began to think so much that I forgot all about \nmy body.  While thinking, I forgot all the activities, and dispelled all \nthose thoughts in such a way that it was as if  I had not even stayed at \nLake Kãnkariã, and as if there had been no festival; no thoughts \nremained at all. \n \n22.6 “After those worldly thoughts had subsided, I began to look within.  I \nbegan to see alokik powers and also the pleasures of the devs.  I \nbegan to see countless types of heavenly vehicles, apsãrãs, clothes, \nand jewellery – just as if I were seeing them here in Mrutyu-Lok.  \nHowever, in my heart I did not like anything except Bhagvãn.  \nMoreover, just as the panch-vishays here appear to be insignificant to \nme – with my mind never being tempted – in the same way, my mind \nwas not tempted anywhere from Dev-Lok all the way to Brahm-Lok. \n \n22.7 “Seeing this, all the devs began to praise me, ‘You truly are an ekãntik \nbhakta of Bhagvãn; after all, your mind did not abandon Bhagvãn and \nbecome tempted elsewhere’.  On hearing their words, my heart gained \na lot of courage.  I then told my man, ‘I know your true svarup.  So, if \nyou have a thought about any object other than Bhagvãn, I will crush \nyou to pieces’.  In the same way, I told my buddhi, ‘If you have any \nbelief other than that of Bhagvãn, then you will be in trouble’.  \nSimilarly, I told my chitt, ‘If you think about anything other than \nBhagvãn, then I will also crush you to pieces’.  In the same way, I told \nmy ahankãr, ‘If you have any form of arrogance except that of \nservitude towards Bhagvãn, I will destroy you’. \n \n22.8 “Following this, just as I had totally forgotten all the objects of this \nlok, I also totally forgot all the objects of Dev-lok and Brahm-Lok.  \nWhen all of those thoughts were dispelled, the illness that had arisen \nas a result of those thoughts also disappeared.  Therefore, a person \nwho is a bhakta of Bhagvãn should behave in this way.”  Shreeji \nMahãrãj narrated His own experiences for the sake of the kalyãn of \nHis bhaktas, while in reality; He Himself is the pratyaksha svarup of \nShree Krishna Purushottam Nãrãyan. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 497 - \n22.9 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “The Vãsudev Mahãtmya describes the \ndharma of an ekãntik bhakta as follows:  ‘An ekãntik bhakta does not \nbelieve his body to be his own true svarup; he believes himself to be \ncomposed of chaitanya.  He performs bhakti of Bhagvãn while \nobserving svadharma, gnãn, and vairãgya.  Also, he maintains no desire \nfor any object other than Bhagvãn’.  When he becomes such a sãdhu \nby worshipping Bhagvãn in this way, there is no greater status.  For \nexample, in a kingdom, the queen’s authority is equal to that of the \nking.  In the same way, that sãdhu possesses as much majesty as \nBhagvãn.  Therefore, a sãdhu should not wish for the insignificant \npleasures of worldly life.  This is because when that sãdhu attains the \ndhãm of Bhagvãn, then just as the lords of countless millions of \nbrahmãnds bring countless types of gifts for Bhagvãn, they also bring \nthem for that sãdhu.  Moreover, by the grace of Bhagvãn, that sãdhu \nacquires alokik powers and strength.  Keeping such a great thought in \nthe mind, a person should not desire anything other than Bhagvãn.  \nFor example, a person who has obtained a chintãmani should look \nafter it with great care.  This is because it will enable him to obtain \nany object he desires.  Similarly, a bhakta of Bhagvãn should hold on \nto the chintãmani in the form of Bhagvãn’s murti; he should never \nabandon it.  Only then will he attain everything.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 22 || 154 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 23 \nHeat And Frost \n \n23.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on  Jyeshth sud 11 [31st May 1822], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in front of the mandir of \nShree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas wearing a white khes and had also covered Himself with a white \nchãdar.  He had tied a white pãgh around His head.  A sabhã of munis, \nas well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 498 - \n23.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Today, I thought about the nature of the \nmind.  It appears that the mind is not separate from the jeev; it is a \nreflection of the jeev itself, but not separate from it.  I also observed \nthat the nature of the mind is like the heat of summer and the frost of \nwinter.  Just as a person can die from heat or frost, in the same way, \nwhen the mind travels towards the vishays via the indriyas, if those \nvishays are full of miseries, the mind becomes ‘hot’ like the heat of \nsummer; and if those vishays are full of happiness, then the mind \nbecomes ‘cold’ like the frost of winter.  Specifically, when the mind – \nhaving indulged in those vishays which are full of misery and having \nbecome ‘hot’ like the scorching winds of summer heat – enters a \nperson’s heart, it makes the person extremely miserable and forces \nhim to fall from the path of kalyãn.  Such a person should be known \nto have died from the effects of heat.  When the mind – having \nindulged in the pleasures of those vishays that are full of happiness \nand having become ‘cold’ like frost – enters a person’s heart, it makes \nthat person satisfied, and causes him to fall from the path of kalyãn.  \nHe should be known to have died due to frost. \n \n23.3 “However, a person whose mind remains unmoved – it does not \nbecome ‘hot’ upon experiencing repulsive vishays and does not \nbecome ‘cold’ upon experiencing pleasurable vishays – should be \nknown as a param-bhãgvat sant.  However, it is no small achievement \nto develop the mind in this way. \n \n23.4 “Moreover, the mind is like a child.  If a child attempts to grasp a \nsnake, or touch a flame, or perhaps hold an unsheathed sword, it \nbecomes upset when it is not allowed to do so; and even if it is \nallowed to do so, it will be hurt and upset.  Similarly, if the mind is \nnot allowed to indulge in them, it turns away from Bhagvãn, and \nbecomes extremely miserable.  Therefore, only a person whose mind \nhas a craving for Bhagvãn and which becomes neither ‘hot’ nor ‘cold’ \nby the vishays, should be known as a sãdhu.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 23 || 156 || \nGADHADÃ II \n- 499 - \nGadhadã II – 24 \nFirmness In Sãnkhya And In Yog \n \n24.1 In the Samvat year 1879, on Shrãvan sud 8 [26th July 1822], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj arrived at Lakshmi-Vãdi on horseback \nfrom Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  There, He sat on a platform \nfacing north.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  He was \nwearing a garland of mogrã flowers around His neck, and a tassel of \nmogrã flowers was also inserted in His pãgh.  A sabhã of paramhans, \nas well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n24.2 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “Mahãrãj, does a \nbhakta who has firm belief in Bhagvãn experience any obstacles, or \nnot?” \n \n24.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A bhakta may be firm in two ways:  One is \nby being firm in yog, and the other is by being firm in sãnkhya.  Of \nthese, a bhakta who is firm in yog keeps his vrutti constantly fixed on \nthe svarup of Bhagvãn.  A bhakta who is firm in sãnkhya understands \nthe extent of human pleasures, as well as the extent of the pleasures \nof the great yogis, chãrans, vidyãdhars, gandharvas, and devs.  In \naddition, he considers the pleasures of the fourteen loks and believes, \n‘These pleasures are only so much’.  He also considers the miseries \nthat follow those pleasures.  As a result, he develops vairãgya \ntowards those misery-filled pleasures, and maintains profound love \nonly for Bhagvãn.  So, a person who is firm in sãnkhya possesses the \nstrength of understanding. \n \n24.4 “In comparison, the strength of a person who is firm in yog is based \nonly on keeping his vrutti constantly on the svarup of Bhagvãn.  If he \nwere \nto \nencounter some \ndisturbances \ndue \nto \nunpleasant \ncircumstances, then although his vrutti was originally fixed on \nBhagvãn’s svarup, it would become attached elsewhere as well.  This \nis because a person who is firm in yog somewhere lacks the strength \nof understanding.  Therefore, it is possible that such a bhakta may \nexperience obstacles. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 500 - \n24.5 “However, if a person is firm in both sãnkhya and yog, then there \nwould be no problem whatsoever.  Such a bhakta of Bhagvãn is never \ntempted by any other object than the murti of Bhagvãn.  He realises, \n‘With the exception of Bhagvãn’s Akshardhãm, and Bhagvãn’s murti \nand the bhaktas within Akshardhãm, everything else – all the loks, the \ndevs, and the wealth of the devs – is perishable’.  Realising this, he \nmaintains profound love only for Bhagvãn.  Such a bhakta never \nexperiences any sort of obstacles whatsoever.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 24 || 157 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 25 \nA Tyãgi With Worldly Desires, And A Grahastha With No Desires \n \n25.1 In the Samvat year 1879, on Shrãvan vad 6 [8th August 1822], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on \nthe veranda outside the south-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr \nin Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of \nmunis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n25.2 Addressing all the paramhans, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please listen, as \nI wish to ask you a question.  First, suppose there is a tyãgi bhakta of \nBhagvãn who is strict in following the physical vartmãn.  However, \nwithin his heart, he has an intense desire to indulge in the vishays.  \nNevertheless, he does not physically give in to those desires.  Such is \nthe tyãgi.  There is another bhakta who is a grahastha.  Physically, he \nhas close contact with both women and wealth.  However, in his \nheart, he is free of all worldly desires.  So, the question is what will be \ntheir fate after death?  Will they both attain the same state?  Or will \none become superior to the other?  Please consider the differences \nbetween the two and give an answer for each separately. \n \n25.3 Then, Gopãlãnand Swãmi replied, “When the tyãgi passes away, \nbecause of the intense desires in his heart to indulge in the vishays, \nGADHADÃ II \n- 501 - \nBhagvãn will make him a wealthy grahastha either in this Mrutyu-\nLok or in Dev-Lok, where he will attain a great amount of vishays to \nindulge in.  In fact, in Dev-Lok, he will indulge in vishays like those of \na person who had strayed from his spiritual activities as described in \nthe Bhagvad Geetã. \n \n25.4 “On the other hand, when the grahastha bhakta passes away, because \nhe is free of worldly desires, he will attain the dhãm of Bhagvãn – \nBrahmpur – where he will reside at the holy feet of Bhagvãn. \n \n25.5 “As far as the tyãgi is concerned, when he becomes satisfied after \nindulging in the vishays, he will eventually develop vairãgya towards \nthem; and then, feeling guilty in his mind, he will engage in the \nworship of Bhagvãn.  Then, he will become free of worldly desires \nand attain the dhãm of Bhagvãn.” \n \n25.6 Hearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj commented, “Correct.  That is the exact \nanswer to the question.” \n \n25.7 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “If a person has such strong worldly \ndesires and wishes to eradicate them, by which method can they be \neradicated?” \n \n25.8 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Just as Ukã Khãchar has become addicted to \nserving the sãdhus, in the same way, if a person becomes addicted to \nserving Bhagvãn and His sant to the extent that he would not be able \nto stay for even a moment without serving them, then all the impure \ndesires in his antah-karans will be destroyed.” \n \n25.9 Then, Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, by which means \nis Bhagvãn extremely pleased?” \n \n25.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a bhakta who once had only twenty \nkilograms of grains in his house were to attain the control of a village, \nor the control of five villages, or the control of fifty villages, or the \nGADHADÃ II \n- 502 - \ncontrol of one hundred villages, or even the control of the entire \nworld; and after this, if he remains just as loving and humble with a \nsant as he was when he was poor and modest, and if he remains just \nas humble even if he were to attain the kingdom of Indra-Lok and \nBrahm-Lok, then Bhagvãn would be extremely pleased upon him. \n \n25.11 “As for a tyãgi, even after attaining powers similar to those possessed \nby Bhagvãn, if he can continue to serve all sãdhus in exactly the same \nway as he did when he was new and timid, and not attempt to impose \nhis authority upon other sãdhus or try to compete with them, then \nBhagvãn would be extremely pleased with him.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 25 || 158 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 26 \nObstactles Of Bhakti \nThat Which Displeases Bhagvãn Should Not Be Done \n \n26.1 In the Samvat year 1879, on the night of Bhãdarvã sud 11 [29th \nAugust 1822], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in front of the mandir of \nShree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well \nas haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n26.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A bhakta of Bhagvãn should never do \nanything that displeases Bhagvãn and His bhaktas, and he should also \nabandon all those who obstruct him in worshipping Bhagvãn, even if \nthey are his own relatives.  Also, just as a person abandons an enemy, \nhe should abandon any svabhãv that does not please Bhagvãn.  \nFurthermore, he should never support those who are vimukhs, just as \nBharatji did not support his own mother.  Also, a bhakta of Bhagvãn \nshould mainly perceive avgun in himself.  On the other hand, a person \nwho perceives avgun in others and only gun in himself, may be \nknown as a satsangi, but he should be known to be half-fallen. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 503 - \n26.3 “Furthermore, for a bhakta of Bhagvãn, if gnãn of the ãtmã, vairãgya, \nor dharma are an obstacle in his bhakti towards Bhagvãn, then he \nshould suppress even them and maintain the predominance of bhakti \nonly.  However, if they are supportive in offering bhakti, then they are \nfine.  Only a person who has this understanding can be called a \ncomplete bhakta of Bhagvãn. \n \n26.4 “Also, no matter how great he may be, if a person perceives avgun in \nothers and gun in himself, he will certainly encounter obstacles on \nthe path of kalyãn.  For example, Rãdhikãji was great and she also had \nintense love for Bhagvãn.  However, when she perceived gun in \nherself and avgun in Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, a trace of tamo-gun \nentered into her love for Him.  Then, she quarrelled with Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn and Shreedãmã.  As a result of this, Shreedãmã \ncursed her.  Rãdhikãji then fell from Golok, and took birth in the home \nof a carpenter.  She had to marry a man other than Bhagvãn, and \nsuffered a severe disgrace.  Even Shreedãmã perceived gun in \nhimself, and perceived avgun in Rãdhikãji.  For that reason, he was \ncursed by Rãdhikãji and had to become a demon. \n \n26.5 “However, this is not the way of falling from the dhãm of Bhagvãn; for \nthose who have fallen have done so due to Bhagvãn’s will.  After all, \nBhagvãn has declared, ‘Even a person who is as great as Rãdhikãji will \nfall if he perceives gun in himself and perceives avgun in bhaktas of \nBhagvãn.  If that is so, what can be said of others?’  Therefore, a bhakta \nof Bhagvãn should see only gun in all satsangis and should find only \navgun in himself.  If a person has such an understanding, then even if \nhe is not very intelligent, his satsang still becomes stronger day by \nday.  Without it, even if he is very intelligent, he will fall back from \nsatsang; and in the end will certainly become a vimukh. \n \n26.6 “Also, the following practice is observed everywhere:  When a king or \na guru lectures and disciplines a servant or a shishya, if the servant or \nshishya accepts it positively, then the king or the guru has \nGADHADÃ II \n- 504 - \ntremendous affection for him.  However, they do not feel affection \ntowards a person who reacts negatively when given such advice.  \nBhagvãn’s method is similar.  When He gives advice to someone, if \nthey accept it positively, He develops affection for them; and if they \nreact negatively, He does not develop affection for them.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 26 || 159 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 27 \nMandirs Built For Bhakti And Upãsanã \n \n27.1 In the Samvat year 1879, on Kãrtik sud 11 [25th November 1822], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda \noutside the south-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  \nHe was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A garland of white and \nyellow guldãvadi flowers adorned His neck, and tassels hung from \nboth sides of His pãgh.  A sabhã of paramhans as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places had gathered before Him. \n \n27.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked Muktãnand Swãmi, “What causes krodh \nto arise within you?  Also, how much of that cause does it take for you \nto become angry?  As for me, even if someone spends anything from \none to one hundred thousand rupees, I would not become angry for \nmy own sake.  However, if someone disobeys his own dharma, or if \nan arrogant person abuses a humble person, or if someone sides with \ninjustice, then for the sake of another person, I do become angry for a \nbrief moment; but never do I become angry for my own sake.  Even \nwhen I do express krodh for the sake of another person, it does not \nlast for even a second, nor is any grudge formed.  So, my question to \nyou is what causes krodh to arise within you and how is it \neradicated?” \n \n27.3 Muktãnand Swãmi relied, “Krodh arises due to association with some \nobjects or on seeing evil in a person; but it subsides instantly.” \nGADHADÃ II \n- 505 - \n27.4 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “By what thought process do you \nmanage to do that?” \n  \n27.5 Muktãnand Swãmi replied, “First, by thinking of Bhagvãn’s greatness, \nI realise, ‘I do not wish to retain any svabhãvs that would displease \nBhagvãn’.  Secondly, after examining the path of sãdhus like Shukji \nand Jadbharat, I think, ‘Such an inappropriate svabhãv does not suit a \nsãdhu’.” \n \n27.6 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj commented, “Such a thought that is capable of \nrepelling the force of kãm and krodh, is beyond the gun of Mãyã, and \nit is firm in your jeev.  In fact, such thoughts that repel the influence of \nkãm and krodh are due to the sanskãrs of past lives.  Also, regarding \nyour nature, I know this much:  Initially, you may become attached to \nworldly objects that you come across, but in the end, you do not \nremain attached to them; you are capable of breaking that bondage.” \n \n27.7 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi questioned, “Why does the deficiency of \nbecoming influenced in the first place still remain?” \n \n27.8 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Each of the eight factors of desh, kãl, kriyã, \nsang, dhyãn, mantra, dikshã, and shãstra, has a force equal to that of \nthe past sanskãrs.  Therefore, when a person encounters them, they \noverpower the force of the past sanskãrs.  After all, if good deeds and \nbad deeds are performed only by the influence of a person’s sanskãrs, \nthen all the distinctions of vidhi and nishedh – ‘This should be done \nand this should not be done’ – as prescribed in the Veds, the six-\nshãstras, and the Purãns, would become meaningless.  But, these \nshãstras, which have been written by the great, can never become \nfalse. \n \n27.9 “Just see, Jay and Vijay behaved improperly, and as a result they fell \nfrom the dhãm of Bhagvãn, where there is no influence of Kãl, karma, \nor Mãyã.  On the other hand, Prahlãd pleased Nãradji and therefore, \neven though circumstances were unpleasant, they were unable to \nGADHADÃ II \n- 506 - \nobstruct him.  However, even though circumstances were pleasant in \nJay and Vijay’s case, because the Sanakãdik were angered, Jay and \nVijay fell from the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  Therefore, a person who wishes \nto attain kalyãn should do whatever pleases the great sant.  Such a \nsant becomes pleased when there are no traces of impure desires left \nwithin a person’s heart. \n \n27.10 “A person should keep in mind, that a person who has krodh and \nother vicious natures towards a humble person, will develop such \nfeelings towards the great, and then also towards his ishta-dev.  \nTherefore, a person wishing to attain kalyãn should not have any \nvicious feelings towards anyone; and if he does, then he is sure to \ndevelop hatred towards bhaktas of Bhagvãn, and then eventually \ntowards Bhagvãn as well. \n \n27.11 “That is why if I have upset even one humble person, I think, \n‘Bhagvãn resides as antaryãmi in all.  While staying in one place, He \nknows what is in everyone’s heart.  So, since He must also be present in \nthe heart of the person whom I have upset, I have offended Bhagvãn as \nwell’.  Realising this, I bow down to him, give him whatever he \nwishes, and do whatever is necessary to please him.” \n \n27.12 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, “I have thought and \nrealised that if a person maintains too much tyãg or too much \ncompassion, then he cannot offer bhakti towards Bhagvãn, and \ntherefore causing him to betray his upãsanã.  For example, from the \npast, we notice that upãsanã eventually perished in those who were \nextreme tyãgis.  Therefore, having thought about this, and for the \nsake of preserving upãsanã, I have relaxed the emphasis on tyãg and \nhave built mandirs of Bhagvãn.  So, even if only a little tyãg remains, \nupãsanã will at least be preserved, and through it, many jeevs will \nattain kalyãn. \n \n27.13 “On the other hand, how is it possible for a person who wishes to \noffer bhakti to Bhagvãn to retain compassion like that of Jain sãdhus?  \nGADHADÃ II \n- 507 - \nAfter all, a bhakta is required to pick flowers and tulsi for Bhagvãn; \nhe is required to bring various types of vegetables, and to grow \ngardens for Bhagvãn; he must also build mandirs.  Therefore, a \nperson who sits idly, maintaining extreme tyãg and compassion, is \nunable to offer bhakti to Bhagvãn.  When bhakti diminishes, the \nupãsanã of Bhagvãn is also destroyed, and a lineage of blind \nfollowers results.  That is why I have had mandirs built – for the \npurpose of preserving Bhagvãn’s upãsanã forever. \n \n27.14 “Moreover, a bhakta with upãsanã never deviates from his dharma.  \nTherefore, my principle is to perform the bhakti and upãsanã of \nBhagvãn while maintaining dharma.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 27 || 160 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 28 \nServing A Bhakta Pleases Bhagvan \n \n28.1 In the Samvat year 1879, on Fãgan sud 2 [13th February, 1823], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting facing west on a \nsquare platform at His residence in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with \na white chãdar.  He had also tied a white pãgh around His head.  A \nsabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \n28.2 Then, Prãgji Davé said, “There is no shãstra like the Shreemad \nBhãgvat.”  \n \n28.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Yes, the Shreemad Bhãgvat is certainly \ngood, but there is no shãstra like the Vãsudev Mahãtmya, which is a \npart of the Skand Purãn.  After all, in that shãstra, great emphasis has \nbeen placed on dharma, bhakti, gnãn, and vairãgya, as well as ahinsã.” \nGADHADÃ II \n- 508 - \n28.4 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, “The Vãlmiki Rãmãyan \nand Harivansh have placed great emphasis on hinsã.  In fact, even \nRãmchandraji behaved according to the characteristics of a kshatriya.  \nEven though Rãmchandraji protected anyone who sought refuge at \nHis feet, He would immediately abandon them if they committed \neven the slightest mistake.  For example, even though Sitãji became \nsubject to only minor public criticism, He instantly abandoned her, \neven though she was very dear to him.” \n \n28.5 Hearing this, Muktãnand Swãmi commented, “Rãmãnand Swãmi’s \nnature was similar.” \n \n28.6 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj revealed, “My nature is not like that.  I have \ngreat compassion for bhaktas of Bhagvãn.  Of the Pãndavs, Arjun was \nalso of a very compassionate nature.  Amongst all men, there has \nbeen no man like Rãmchandraji and Arjun, and amongst all women \nthere has been no woman like Sitãji and Draupadi. \n \n28.7 “Now, I shall describe my own nature.  Even though I have a \ncompassionate nature, if a person spites bhaktas of Bhagvãn, then I \nhave a dislike towards that person.  If I hear someone speaking \nunpleasantly of bhaktas, then I would not feel like speaking to them, \neven if I had to.  On the other hand, I become extremely pleased with \nsomeone who serves the bhaktas of Bhagvãn.  In fact, my nature is \nsuch that I do not become easily pleased or displeased over small \nmatters, but only after observation over several days of whether a \nperson is worthy of my pleasure or displeasure, do I become pleased \nor displeased.  I never become pleased or displeased with a person \nby simply hearing someone’s opinions of that person; I only \nappreciate those qualities that I perceive with my own mind.  Also, \nmy preference is as follows: ‘If a person is a genuine bhakta of \nBhagvãn, then I am a bhakta of that bhakta, and I do the bhakti of such \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn’.  This is my greatest quality.  A person who does \nnot have that quality is not worthy of any type of greatness. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 509 - \n28.8 “Conversely, those who have perceived avgun in bhaktas of Bhagvãn, \neven though they were very great, have fallen from their status of \nimportance.  Those who progress do so only by serving bhaktas of \nBhagvãn, and those who regress do so only by spiting bhaktas of \nBhagvãn.  In fact, the only method for a person to please Bhagvãn is \nto serve bhaktas by thought, word, and deed.  The only method to \ndisplease Bhagvãn is to spite bhaktas. \n \n28.9 “Therefore, my principle is that if Bhagvãn is pleased with me, and I \nhave the company of the bhaktas of Bhagvãn, then even if I were to \nstay far away from Bhagvãn for countless years, I would not feel any \ngrief mentally.  On the other hand, if Bhagvãn is not pleased with me, \nthen even if I were to stay near Bhagvãn, I would not consider that to \nbe good.  Moreover, the essence of all the shãstras is ‘A person should \nonly do that which pleases Bhagvãn’.  In fact, a person who does not \ndo that which pleases Bhagvãn should be known to have fallen from \nthe path of Bhagvãn. \n \n28.10 “If a person has the company of the bhaktas of Bhagvãn and also has \nearned Bhagvãn’s pleasure, then even though he is in Mrutyu-Lok, he \nis still in the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  This is because a person who serves a \nsant and earns Bhagvãn’s favour will certainly stay near Bhagvãn.  \nConversely, even if a bhakta is in the dhãm of Bhagvãn, if he has not \nearned Bhagvãn’s favour and is jealous of bhaktas of Bhagvãn, then \nthat bhakta will certainly fall from that dhãm. \n \n28.11 “For this reason, in order to please Bhagvãn, I desire only to serve \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn in this life and all subsequent lives.  Furthermore, \njust as this is my belief, all of you should also make the same belief.” \n \n28.12 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi and all the other bhaktas folded their hands \nin prayer and said, “Mahãrãj, we also wish to keep such a belief.”  \nHaving said this, all the bhaktas pledged and bowed at Shreeji \nMahãrãj’s feet. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 510 - \n28.13 Finally, Shreeji Mahãrãj added, “I have delivered this talk to you after \nhearing and extracting the essence from the Veds, the six-shãstras, \nthe Purãns and all other words on this earth relating to moksh.  This \nis the most profound and fundamental principle, and it is the essence \nof all essences.  For all those who have previously attained moksh, for \nall those who will attain it in the future, and for all those who are \npresently treading the path of moksh, this talk is like a lifeline.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã I || 28 || 162 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 29 \nThe Characteristics Of A Person Who Is Attached To Bhagvãn \n \n29.1 In the Samvat year 1879, on Fãgan sud 8 [18th February 1823], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Dada \nKhãchar's darbãr in Gadhadã.

Also, regardless of any disease or illness that may be a source \nof pain for them, and regardless of being insulted, if they hear talks \nabout Bhagvãn, then they would instantly be relieved of all their \nmiseries.  Furthermore, they may appear to be totally engrossed in \nthe wealth and property they have attained, but the moment they \nhear talks of Bhagvãn, it would seem as if they have no association \nGADHADÃ II \n- 511 - \nwith anything else.

A person who has these characteristics should be \nknown to have developed deep attachment to Bhagvãn.” \n \n29.3 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “How does such deep attachment \ntowards Bhagvãn develop?” \n \n29.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Either due to very strong sanskãrs from past \nlives, or by serving and therefore pleasing the sant of Bhagvãn who \nhas such firm attachment with Bhagvãn – these two methods help \ncreate deep attachment towards Bhagvãn.  Besides these, there are \nno other methods.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 29 || 162 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 30 \nWomen And Gold \n \n30.1 In the Samvat year 1879, on sud 9 of the second Chaitra [19th April \n1823], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress \nwith a large, cylindrical pillow on the veranda outside the mandir of \nShree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white \nchãdar.  He had tied a black-bordered cloth around His head, and a \ntassel of flowers was hanging from His pãgh.  He was also wearing a \ngarland of flowers around His neck.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n30.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The Shreemad Bhãgvat and the other \nsacred shãstras are satya; so reality reflects what is stated in those \nshãstras.  Just see, in the Shreemad Bhãgvat, it is said that Kali (Kali-\nYug) resides in gold; and for that reason, I do not like even the sight \nof gold.  Also, like gold, beauty is a source of attachment.  After all, \nGADHADÃ II \n- 512 - \nwhen a beautiful woman enters a sabhã, even the most composed \nperson cannot remain without being drawn towards her beauty.  \nTherefore, gold and women are the source of extreme attachment. \n \n30.3 “A person does not become attached to gold and women when he \nrealises the pure chaitanya brahm as the only satya; when he realises \nthat brahm to be his own self; when he becomes brahm-rup and \nworships Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, who is Parbrahm; when he realises \nPrakruti and all the entities which have evolved from it – all of which \nare below Brahm – as being asatya, perishable, and worthless; and \nwhen he views all mãyik names and forms as flawed and develops \nintense vairãgya towards all those names and forms.  Only under \nthese conditions do gold and women not bind a person; otherwise, \nthey most certainly will cause a person to become bound by them.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 30 || 163 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 31 \nJeev, Ishvar, Mãyã, Brahm, Parbrahm \n \n31.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Shrãvan sud 4 [10th August 1823], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a large, cylindrical \npillow that had been placed on a square platform at His residence in \nDãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  He had also tied a black-bordered cloth around His head.  A \nsabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places had \ngathered before Him.  At that time, the Kapil Geetã (a section of the \nShreemad Bhãgvat) was being read by the Prãgji Davé. \n \n31.2 Following the reading, Shreeji Mahãrãj said to the paramhans, \n“Vãsudev Bhagvãn – who is Purushottam, the cause of all causes, and \nwho is greater than Akshar – implants masculine power in Mahã-\nMãyã through Mahã-Purush.  That Purush is like Akshar, he is a \nGADHADÃ II \n- 513 - \nmukta, and he is also known as Brahm.  When that Purush implants \nhis masculine power in Mãyã, Virãt-Purush is said to be the son of its \nrespective Purush.  Just as a brãhman, a kshatriya, a vaishya, or \nanother man of this world produces a son with his wife, similarly, \nVirãt-Purush is also produced. \n \n31.3 “That Virãt-Purush is just like this jeev, and his actions are also \nsimilar to the jeev.  The lifespan of that Virãt-Purush is two parãrdhs.  \nThe creation, sustenance, and destruction of this universe are his \nthree states, just as jãgrat, svapna, and sushupti are the three states of \nthe jeev.  Virãt, sutrãtmã, and avyãkrut are the three bodies of that \nVirãt-Purush.  These bodies, which are encircled by the eight barriers \n(jad prakruti), have been produced from the twenty-four tattvas. \n \n31.4 “The indriyas, antah-karans, and their presiding devs entered that \nVirãt and attempted to awaken him.  Despite Virat’s jeev being inside \nhis body, Virãt still did not awaken.  Only when Vãsudev Bhagvãn – \nthe kshetragna – entered within him in the svarup of Purush did the \nbody of Virãt awaken.  Only then did Virãt-Purush become capable of \nperforming all his activities. \n \n31.5 “To inspire the jeev, that same Bhagvãn – while remaining beyond \nMãyã in the form of sushupti – resides in the jeev as its witness.  \nHowever, the jeev has been associated with the body, the indriyas, \nand the vishays.  As a result of this improper association, the jeev has \nbecome one with the body, and the indriyas.  After abandoning their \nassociation, the jeev realises, ‘My self is brahm, which is transcendental \nand free from mãyã.’  If a person associates with brahm through \ncontinuous thinking in this way, the jeev acquires the qualities of that \nbrahm.  However, it is a great fault of the jeev that even after hearing \nthis fact, it cannot maintain constant remembrance that it is brahm.   \n \n31.6 “In this way, the inspirer of both the ishvar (Virãt-Purush) and of this \njeev is Purushottam – also known as Vãsudev – in the svarup of \nGADHADÃ II \n- 514 - \nPurush.  Like the jeev, that Virãt-Purush is also bound by mãyã; and \nremains bound until he completes his lifespan of two parãrdhs.  \nWhen he dies, he gets direct contact with that Purush.  This is because \nhis father (Purush) is powerful and cares for him appropriately.  So, \nbecause Virãt-Purush is attached to Mãyã, he is again produced from \nMãyã at the end of destruction. \n \n31.7 “Moreover, just as the jeev is bound and powerless, in the same way \nits father is also bound and powerless.  Then, how can the father help \nthe son?  Therefore, the jeev remains continuously attached to mãyã \nin the form of sushupti.  However, that attachment is never broken.  It \nis only broken when a person constantly associates with his inspirer \n(brahm), through thinking – as previously described. \n \n31.8 “Also, Virãt-Purush worships Sankarshan, Aniruddha, and Pradyumna.  \nSpecifically, during the state of destruction, he worships Sankarshan; \nduring the state of sustenance, he worships Pradyumna; and during \nthe state of creation, he worships Aniruddha.  In fact, Sankarshan, \nAniruddha, and Pradyumna are the sagun svarups of Vãsudev \nBhagvãn, and it is the strength of the upãsanã of Virãt-Purush that he \nbecomes capable of performing the activities of creation, sustenance, \nand destruction.  Moreover, as long as he worships these three, his \nassociation with Mãyã – in the form of creation, sustenance, and \ndestruction – is not broken.  It is when he worships Vãsudev Bhagvãn, \nwho is nirgun, that Virãt-Purush abandons Mãyã and becomes brahm-\nrup.  Similarly, when the jeev worships Bhagvãn in the svarup of \nBrahma and other devs, it attains rewards in the form of dharma, \narth, and kãm.  However, when it worships the avatãrs of Bhagvãn, it \nbecomes brahm-rup and attains kalyãn.  The same applies for Virãt-\nPurush. \n \n31.9 “Now, it is said in the shãstras that the avatãrs are formed from that \nVirãt-Purush.  This should be understood as follows:  When Vãsudev-\nNãrãyan – through the svarup of Purush – comes and resides in Virãt-\nGADHADÃ II \n- 515 - \nPurush, He is said to be an avatãr.  Therefore, all those avatãrs are \nVãsudev Bhagvãn’s only.  When the Vãsudev Bhagvãn withdraws \nHimself and separates from Virãt-Purush, then it is not possible for an \navatãr to be formed through Virãt-Purush alone.  Therefore, the \ndescriptions of avatãrs manifesting through him are only because of \nthe presence of Vãsudev in him.  In fact, when Vãsudev – the \nkshetragna – had not yet entered him, that Virãt-Purush was not even \ncapable of performing any of his own activities. \n \n31.10 “When Purush impregnates Mãyã, a son in the form of Virãt-Purush is \nproduced via Pradhãn-Purush.  From that same Mãyã, many \nbrahmãnds – in the form of many Virãt-Purush – are produced via \ncountless Pradhãn-Purush pairs.  Furthermore, that Purush has no \ndesires, he is a mukta, he is brahm-rup, and he is the cause of Mãyã.  \nAlthough he stays within Mãyã, he still remains unaffected by Mãyã.  \nAlso, he has no desire to enjoy Mãyã since he is happy due to the bliss \nof brahm; therefore, he is fulfilled. \n \n31.11 “The ishvar known as Virãt-Purush indulges in the pleasures of mãyã \nand then, at the time of destruction, abandons Mãyã.  On the other \nhand, the jeev indulges in the pleasures of mãyã and then merges into \nMãyã, remaining miserable.” \n \n31.12 Shuk Muni then asked, “Purushottam Vãsudev, in the svarup of \nPurush, is the cause of the creation, sustenance, and destruction of \ncountless brahmãnds.  Consequently, the shãstras generally describe \nPurushottam as Purush.  But, what is the extent of the distinction \nbetween Purush and Vãsudev?” \n \n31.13 Shreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “Just as there is a difference between \nthe jeev and Virãt-Purush, who is an ishvar; and just as there is also a \ndifference between ishvar and Purush, similarly, there is an immense \ndifference between Purush and Vãsudev Bhagvãn.  Purushottam \nVãsudev Bhagvãn is the master of all, whereas there are many such \nGADHADÃ II \n- 516 - \nbrahm-rup Purush who worship the holy feet of Vãsudev and who \noffer to praise to Him.  In this way, Purushottam, Purush, ishvar, jeev, \nand Mãyã are the five eternal entities. \n \n31.14 “I have explained this fact in this way many times, but it is not firmly \nfixed in a person’s heart due to a lack of deep thinking.  As a result, \nafter listening to the words of the shãstras, no stability remains in a \nperson’s understanding.  However, if it has been absolutely fixed, \nthen his understanding would never falter on listening to such words.  \nTherefore, this fact should be thoroughly thought of and written \ndown.”   \n \n31.15 In this way, the talk delivered by Shreeji Mahãrãj has been written. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 31 || 165 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 32 \nDetaching From The Body \n \n32.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Shrãvan sud 5 [11th August 1823], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in His residence in Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  He had tied a black-bordered cloth around His head, and \ngarlands of flowers were hanging around His neck.  Also, bunches of \nflowers had been placed above His ears, and tassels of flowers were \nplaced upon His head.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n32.2 Then, addressing all of haribhaktas, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “In worldly \nlife, the love a person has for family members is like that of a cactus \nplant or the branch of a banyan or pipal tree – if they are cut and \nplanted elsewhere, they would once again grow into trees.  In \ncomparison, once a mango tree or a neem tree is cut, it does not take \nroot again.  The love that a person has for those other than his family \nGADHADÃ II \n- 517 - \nmembers is like that of the mango tree or the neem tree; whereas the \nlove a person has for his family members is like the cactus plant and \nbanyan tree – if they have been cut down, they definitely do grow \nagain, even while lying in the soil. \n \n32.3 “For this reason, the love that a person has for his family is only \nuprooted when he realises his true svarup to be the jeevãtmã, distinct \nfrom the three bodies of sthul, sukshma and kãran; when, after \ndiscarding all pride of gender, varna and ãshram, he beholds \nBhagvãn’s murti within it; and when he becomes eager to engage only \nin the worship of Bhagvãn.  Only then will the love for his family be \ncompletely cut.  Besides this, there is no other means to do so.” \n \n32.4 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, “The sole cause behind the jeev \nattaining kalyãn, overcoming mãyã, and becoming brahm-svarup is \nits engagement in the gnãn, dhyãn, kirtans, and kathã of the \npratyaksha svarup of Vãsudev Bhagvãn, who is Purushottam.  It is due \nto these that the jeev overcomes mãyã, attains an extremely elevated \nstate, and also attains Bhagvãn’s Akshardhãm.  In this, ãtmã-nishthã, \nvairãgya, and dharma are merely helpful in offering bhakti to \nBhagvãn.  Without the bhakti of Bhagvãn, vairãgya, ãtmã-nishthã, and \ndharma alone are not capable of allowing the jeev to overcome mãyã.  \nIn fact, even if a person does not possess intense dharma, ãtmã-\nnishthã, or vairãgya, if he possesses only bhakti towards Bhagvãn, \nthen he would still attain kalyãn.  This is the power of bhakti over \ndharma, ãtmã-nishthã, and vairãgya. \n \n32.5 “However, only with the help of dharma, ãtmã-nishthã, and vairãgya, \nis unobstructed bhakti possible.  Without those other characteristics, \nthere will definitely be difficulties in offering bhakti during times of \nunpleasant circumstances.  That is why a person should offer bhakti \ncoupled with dharma, ãtmã-nishthã, and vairãgya. \n \n32.6 “Having said this, even if a bhakta who offers such bhakti happens to \nbe confronted by unpleasant desh, kãl, kriyã,  and sang, then although \nGADHADÃ II \n- 518 - \nhe is a bhakta of Bhagvãn, his heart would indeed become disturbed, \nand he would become unpredictable.  Therefore, a person should \nabandon unpleasant desh, unpleasant kãl, unpleasant kriyã, and \nunpleasant sang and forever associate with pleasant desh, pleasant \nkãl, pleasant kriyã, and pleasant sang; but never should a person \nassociate with unpleasant circumstances.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 32 || 165 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 33 \nThe Vow Of Nishkãm \n \n33.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Shrãvan vad 13 [18th September 1823], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \nlarge, cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated \nbedstead in Dãdã Khãchar's darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n33.2 Then, addressing all the sãdhus and bhaktas, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, \n“First, I shall talk about my strengths.  After that, all of you can \ndescribe your personal thoughts on how you feel kalyãn can be \nattained, and you can also explain how you think you should behave \nin order for Bhagvãn to be pleased with you in this lok and other \nloks.” \n \n33.3 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj began to describe His own strength, \nsaying, “If it appears to me that I have a liking for something, I would \nonly be happy after I have discarded it.  Should I recall in my mind \nany object or any person other than bhaktas of Bhagvãn, then I would \nfeel comfortable only after I have totally distanced myself from that \nobject or person.  Also, in my heart, in no way do I ever experience a \ndislike towards a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  Even though I am forcefully \nGADHADÃ II \n- 519 - \noffered the panch-vishays without actually wishing for them myself, I \nstill do not have any desire for them; I push them away.  In fact, I take \noath on the lives of these paramhans that from the day I was born to \nthis very day, I have never had an improper thought regarding \nwomen or wealth, either in the jãgrat state or in the svapna state.  \nTherefore, I am eternally flawless.  A person who perceives any \navgun in me will himself suffer from vicious thoughts both in the \njãgrat and svapna state.  Moreover, he will suffer greatly at the time \nof his death as well. \n \n33.4 “In addition, only the thought of Bhagvãn remains within my heart, \nand although I outwardly meet and associate with bhaktas of \nBhagvãn, it is solely for the benefit of their jeevs.  Indeed, the day \nwhen I feel that I have developed love for something other than the \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn, I will consider myself as having been displaced \nfrom my spiritual status.  However, I am confident that that would \nnever happen.  Therefore, I have described my strength to you.  Now, \nall of you can describe your own personal strengths.” \n \n33.5 Hearing this, all the sãdhus and bhaktas each described their \nstrengths, which were their beliefs as to how Bhagvãn would be \npleased upon them if they were to abide by that strength in this lok \nand other loks.  Of them, some described how they possess vairãgya \nof everything except Bhagvãn; others mentioned their quality of \nãtmã-nishthã; some spoke of their love for Bhagvãn; and some \nmentioned their observance of dharma.  In this way, many different \nstrengths were mentioned.  However, no one mentioned the strength \nthat Shreeji Mahãrãj had in mind. \n \n33.6 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “If a person firmly observes the vow of \nnishkãm, then he is never far from Bhagvãn – whether he is in this lok \nor other loks.  Moreover, my love for such a person never diminishes.  \nIn fact, the very reason that I have stayed here is because of the \ndetermination of the bhaktas to observe the vow of nishkãm.  If a \nperson strictly observes that vow, then even if I were a thousand \nGADHADÃ II \n- 520 - \nmiles away from him, I would still be close to him.  Conversely, if a \nperson is slack in his observance of the vow of nishkãm, then even if \nhe is beside me, he is as good as a hundred thousand miles away.  \nAlso, I only like the service offered by a bhakta who is nishkãmi.  It is \nonly because this Mulji Brahm-Chãri is extremely strict in his \nobservance of the vow of nishkãm that I like his sevã very much.  \nHowever, if someone else does sevã, I am not as pleased. \n \n33.7 “Furthermore, in all the talks that I deliver, I always strongly promote \nthe observance of the vow of nishkãm.  I have been firmly reinforcing \nthis since the day I was born. \n \n33.8 “When a sabhã has gathered, if a man or woman looks at someone \nelse with kãm, then no matter how hard they may try to conceal it, it \nnever escapes my attention.  At that time, I become extremely \ndispleased upon that person, and even my face turns red.  It hurts me \ndeeply, but feeling obliged, I cannot say much.  Furthermore, being a \nsãdhu, I keep my feelings within my heart.  However, if I were to \nadopt the ways of a king, I would punish that person severely. \n \n33.9 “That is why I have already instructed all the senior paramhans and \nsenior women that if any male or female bhakta in satsang commits a \nbreach in his or her observance of the vow of nishkãm, then please do \nnot inform me of it.  This is because I am deeply saddened when I \nhear such things – just as a childless couple would feel saddened if \ntheir newly born son were to suddenly die.  In fact, at such times, I \nfeel like abandoning this satsang and leaving.  Therefore, only those \nwho observe this vow of nishkãm are dear to me; they and I will \nalways be very close, both in his lok and other loks.” \n \n33.10 Then, Harji Thakkar asked, “By what means can a person’s \nobservance of the vow of nishkãm become extremely firm?” \n \n33.11 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “There is a way, and it comprises of three \ncomponents.  Just as many components make up a bull-cart – the \ndriver, the pair of bulls, the wheels, the yoke, the supporting \nGADHADÃ II \n- 521 - \nassembly, and the wooden frame – similarly, many components are \nrequired to be able to firmly observe the vow of nishkãm.  Of these, \nthere are three that are absolutely fundamental. \n \n33.12 “The first is to conquer the mind by constantly thinking, ‘I am the \nãtmã, not the body’.  Also, the mind should be continuously kept \nengaged in the nine types of bhakti.  It should not be left unoccupied \nfor even a moment.  For example, if a man conquers a ghost, but does \nnot assign it some work to do, the ghost would turn onto the man \nhimself.  In this sense, the mind is just like a ghost; when it is not \nengaged in the bhakti of Bhagvãn, it begins to think of evil thoughts.  \nThis can be compared to the ghost getting ready to devour the man.  \nFor this reason, the mind should continuously be kept occupied in \nkathãs and kirtans related to Bhagvãn.  This can be known as having \nconquered the mind. \n \n33.13 “The second component is to keep the prãns under control.  Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn has said in the Bhagvad Geetã, ‘A person’s diet and \nactivity should be kept regulated; he should not keep a strong yearning \nfor food’.  A person who behaves in this way is said to have kept his \nprãns under control.  If this is not done, he will feel an intense \nyearning for food in his mind.  Consequently, his tongue will crave \nafter the countless types of tastes.  As a result, any other indriyas that \nhe may have conquered will also become free.  Therefore, a person \nshould control his prãns by controlling his diet. \n \n33.14 “The third component requires a person to control his body by \nphysically keeping it within the niyams prescribed in satsang for each \nindividual.  \n \n33.15 “So, by strictly observing these three components in this way, a \nperson’s observance of the vow of nishkãm becomes extremely firm.  \nHowever, a person should not consider this to be very difficult to \npractice; it is not at all difficult for someone who is, after all, a sãdhu.  \nThe enemies, such as kãm, krodh, and lobh prevail strongly even in a \nGADHADÃ II \n- 522 - \nsãdhu, but to please Bhagvãn, he would still abandon them; only then \ncan he be called a true sãdhu. \n \n33.16 “After all, what is impossible to achieve with this human body?  That \nwhich is practiced regularly can definitely be achieved.  For example, \ndue to the daily drawing of water from a well, the constant rubbing of \neven a soft rope can cause a groove in the very hard piece of rock that \nlies on the edge of that well.  Similarly, for a person who is a sãdhu \nand who continuously persists in his efforts for eradicating his \nsvabhãvs, how long can those svabhãvs remain?  They most certainly \nwill be destroyed.  Therefore, a person who wishes to observe the \nvow of nishkãm should intensely employ the method that comprises \nof the three components I have just described.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 33 || 166 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 34 \nAre The Tattvas Jad Or Chaitanya? \n \n34.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Bhãdarvã sud 1 [5th September 1823], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda \noutside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  \nHe was wearing a white dhoti and had covered Himself with a white \nchãdar.  He had also tied a black-bordered cloth around His head.  A \nsabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him.  Some of the paramhans were singing kirtans to \nthe accompaniment of a dukad and sarodã. \n \n34.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Please stop the kirtans, and let us conduct \na question-answer discussion in order to dispel drowsiness.” \n \n34.3 Having said that, Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, “First of all, allow me to \nask a question:  The twenty-four tattvas, such as the indriyas and \nantah-karans which are the result of Mãyã, reside in the jeev.  Now, \nare those elements jad, or are they chaitanya?” \nGADHADÃ II \n- 523 - \n \n34.4 The paramhans replied, “Those tattvas are definitely chaitanya.” \n \n34.5 Hearing the reply, Shreeji Mahãrãj contradicted, “If those elements \nare chaitanya, then along with the jeev residing in this body, there \nshould be twenty-four jeevs for the twenty-four tattvas.  Therefore, \nwhen the jeev attains kalyãn, it would be distributed among all of \nthem.  Moreover, all sins that are committed by the jeev would also \nbe distributed among all of them.  Therefore, that which experiences \npleasure and pain cannot be said to be just one jeev.  Furthermore, \nthe three types of karmas – sanchit karmas, prãrabdha karmas, and \nkriyamãn karmas – cannot be said to apply to just one jeev.  \nFurthermore, in the past, when Nãrad and the others attained kalyãn, \nonly their own jeev attained kalyãn, but there is no mention of the \njeevs of the twenty-four tattvas attaining kalyãn as well.” \n \n34.6 By using such logic, Shreeji Mahãrãj proved the tattvas to be without \na jeev.  He then logically disproved each answer given by the \nparamhans.  As a result, the paramhans were unable to answer the \nquestion in any way at all. \n \n34.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Allow me to answer the question.  Due to \nthe indifference between an effect and its cause, there are two types \nof tattvas.  The tattvas that are in the form of cause are chaitanya, and \nthe tattvas that are in the form of the effect are jad.  In actuality, the \njeev resides in the heart; but through its power of consciousness, it \nbehaves with oneness with the body, the indriyas, and the antah-\nkarans.  As a result, the body, the indriyas, and the antah-karans \nappear to be chaitanya; but, in reality, they are jad. \n \n34.8 “When that jeev becomes a bhakta of Bhagvãn and attains the dhãm \nof Bhagvãn, the tattvas that are jad are left behind.  Now, as those \ntwenty-four tattvas are produced from Mãyã, they are forms of Mãyã \nand are jad; they appear differently in the form of the body, the \nindriyas, and the antah-karans.  For example, there is one pruthvi that \nassumes the five forms of the skin, flesh, marrow, bones, and \nGADHADÃ II \n- 524 - \nmuscles.  Due to the skill of the maker, it also comes in the form of \nglass.  In the same way, that Mãyã, due to the will of Bhagvãn, \nappears in different forms (the body, the indriyas, and the antah-\nkarans).” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 34 || 167 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 35 \nUpãsanã Is Required To Attain Kalyãn \n \n35.1 In the Samvat year 1880, two-and-a-half hours before sunrise on \nBhãdarvã sud 11 [16th September 1823], Shreeji Mahãrãj awoke from \nsleep and sat on a decorated bedstead that had been placed over the \nunderground store of grains in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  \nHe was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white \npachhedi.  He had also tied a black-bordered cloth around His head. \n \n35.2 At that time, Shreeji Mahãrãj summoned all the paramhans and \nbhaktas.  Then, addressing them, He began, “I slept very soundly last \nnight, and though I tried very hard to awake, I could not.  During that \nsleep, I thought a great deal.  I have made a decision based upon \nthese thoughts, which I shall now tell you.” \n \n35.3 He then said, “Even before I met Rãmãnand Swãmi, I could see my \nãtmã as if it were before my eyes, and I also see it now.  That ãtmã is \nluminous with light like that of the sun.  Even amidst the activities of \nall my indriyas, I do not lose awareness of that ãtmã for even a \nmoment. \n \n35.4 “In actual fact, such ãtmã-nishthã is very difficult to attain.  Only a \nfortunate person who has sanskãrs of many past lives is able to attain \nsuch ãtmã-nishthã, whereas if someone else were to think about the \nãtmã for even a hundred years, he would still not attain ãtmã-\nnishthã. \n \nGADHADÃ II \n- 525 - \n35.5 “So, how can a person attain ãtmã-nishthã?  Well, when a person \nperforms dhyãn upon the murti of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, it is not at \nall difficult to attain kalyãn.  Conversely, no one should even hope of \nunderstanding or seeing the ãtmã by merely thinking about it \nwithout performing dhyãn upon Bhagvãn.  However, by the upãsanã \nof Bhagvãn, narrating His charitras, chanting His holy name, and \nfollowing dharma, it is not at all difficult for the jeev to attain kalyãn; \nit is an easy path – like crossing the ocean by sitting in a boat.  In \ncontrast, to attain kalyãn through ãtmã-nishthã is a difficult path – \nlike tying gourds to the body and trying to cross the ocean. \n \n35.6 “The only reason why I deliver such talks about knowledge of the \nãtmã is that if a person can realise his ãtmã to be distinct from the \nbody, then he will no longer have any love for his body or for his \nrelatives.  Then, there would no longer be any obstacles in the bhakti \nof Bhagvãn.  This is the only reason; but a person should not think \nthat it is possible to attain kalyãn by the knowledge of the ãtmã \nalone. \n \n35.7 “Also, there are sayings in the world such as, ‘If the mind is pure, then \na vessel of water is as good as Gangã-water’.  So, if the mind is pure, \nthere is no need to bathe in the Gangã to become pure.  However, \nthese words are not true.  Regardless of how much a person may \nhave mastered samãdhi, or how thoughtful he may be, if he begins to \nstay in the close company of women, there is no way in which he \ncould maintain his dharma.  Similarly, regardless of how strict a \nwoman may be in observing dharma, if she stays in the close \ncompany of men, then she would also in no way be able to maintain \nher dharma.  Therefore, no one should believe that men and women \ncan stay in each other’s company and still be able to maintain their \ndharma.  This fact is true, and no one should doubt it. \n \n35.8 “When can a person maintain his dharma?  Only if those who are \nparamhans and brahm-chãris abide by the niyams prescribed for \nGADHADÃ II \n- 526 - \nthem, such as brahm-chãrya, will they be able to maintain their \ndharma.  The same is true for women; only if they abide by the \nniyams prescribed for them will they be able to maintain their \ndharma as well.  In the same way, if all other satsangi grahasthas \nabide by the niyams prescribed for them – including not staying in an \nisolated place with even his young mother, sister, or daughter; and \nnot extensively looking at them either – then they will also be able to \nmaintain their dharma. \n \n35.9 “In this way, following dharma, upãsanã of the svarup of Bhagvãn, \nlistening to and narrating the charitras of Bhagvãn’s avatãrs, and \nchanting His holy name, are the four qualities that are fundamentally \nnecessary for the jeev’s kalyãn. \n \n35.10 “Indeed, all of you realise me to be Bhagvãn.  So, wherever I have \norganised festivals; wherever all the paramhans and brahm-chãris, \nmale and female satsangi bhaktas have gathered; when I have had \nkirtans sung; when I have delivered talks; and when my pujã had \nbeen performed, all such leelãs and charitras should be narrated, \nheard, and thought about in the mind.  If a person remembers these \nduring his last moments, his jeev will certainly attain the dhãm of \nBhagvãn.  In this way, all of my leelãs and charitras, as well as the \nchanting of my name, are kalyãn-kãri.  When I explained this to \nSvarupãnand Swãmi, the agonising pain in his body due to illness was \ncompletely relieved, and he felt profound peace.  In fact, he could see \nhis own ãtmã very well, yet it was of no use. \n \n35.11 “A person should also narrate the listen to the charitras of the \nprevious avatãrs of Bhagvãn, such as Rãm and Krishna, wherever \nthose charitras may have taken place. \n \n35.12 “It is for the purpose of consolidating those four qualities in you that I \ndescribed the importance of the eight shãstras, like Shreemad \nBhãgvat.  Therefore, the shãstras should be read and studied; and \nonly those four qualities should be emphasised. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 527 - \n35.13 “Also, understand that to try to attain kalyãn by only observing \ndharma without the other three qualities – upãsanã of Bhagvãn’s \nmurti, narrating and listening to Bhagvãn’s charitras, and chanting \nHis holy name – would be as difficult as trying to cross the ocean \nafter tying gourds to the body.  Yet, though a person has refuge of the \nmurti of Bhagvãn; though he narrates and listens Bhagvãn’s leelãs \nand charitras; and though he chants the name of Bhagvãn, if he does \nnot observe dharma, he should be known to be as foolish as a person \nwho tries to cross the ocean carrying a stone slab upon his head; he \nshould also be known to be like an outcast. \n \n35.14 “Therefore, a jeev can attain kalyãn only by those four qualities.  \nWithout them, there are no other means by which a person can attain \nkalyãn.  However, a person should only listen to and sing the kirtans \nand poems written by Muktãnand Swãmi and other sãdhus.  Kirtans \nand poems composed by other poets can also be heard and sung if \nthey describe the leelãs and charitras of Bhagvãn.  However, poems \nand kirtans like those composed by the likes of Kabir and Ãkhã \nshould not be sung or heard.” \n \n35.15 Concluding, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “All of you have faith in me.  If I \nwere to mislead you with unfounded talks, it would amount to \nthrowing all of you into a well and sealing it with a stone slab so that \nthere would be no hope of escape.  However, if you are misled along \nthe wrong path because of your faith in my words, then what good \nwould that be to me?  Therefore, these talks are for the sake of your \nkalyãn.  I have told you this out of love for all of you, so now all of you \nshould understand it and strictly live by it.” \n \n35.16 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj finally added, “Now, if you have \ndecided to act according to the talk which I have just delivered, then \ncome forward one by one and touch my feet.  While doing so, take an \noath and pledge, ‘I definitely want to behave accordingly’.” \n \n35.17 Then, all the paramhans and satsangis happily got up and touched \nShreeji Mahãrãj’s holy feet and bowed before Him.  He then told the \nGADHADÃ II \n- 528 - \nladies to do the same.  So, standing at a distance, the ladies also \npledged and took an oath to behave accordingly.  Shreeji Mahãrãj was \nvery pleased with this.  Then, He retired to His residence. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 35 || 168 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 36 \nMaintaining Continuous Vrutti \n \n36.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Bhãdarvã sud Punam [30th September \n1823], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \n \n36.2 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Please conduct a question-answer \ndiscussion.” \n \n36.3 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked a question:  “By what means can a \nperson continuously engage his vrutti on Bhagvãn?” \n \n36.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Actually, there are four methods to achieve \nthis.  Of these, the first method is that the chitt has a tendency of \nbecoming engrossed; so it can become engrossed in everything.  So, \njust as it becomes engrossed in a person’s son or wife, it can also \nbecome engrossed in Bhagvãn.  Therefore, that is one method. \n \n36.5 “The second method is to be extremely brave.  When a person with \nsuch bravery in his heart conceives some desirous thought other \nthan that of Bhagvãn, as he is a brave bhakta, intense thinking arises \nwithin which dispel all desirous thoughts.  Therefore, he \ncontinuously engages his vrutti on the svarup of Bhagvãn. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 529 - \n36.6 “The third method is fear.  If extreme fear of birth, death, Narak, and \nthe cycle of births and deaths exists in a person’s heart, he \ncontinuously engages his vrutti on the svarup of Bhagvãn due to fear. \n \n36.7 “The fourth method is vairãgya.  A person with vairãgya – through \ngnãn of the Sãnkhya shãstras – realises his own ãtmã to be distinct \nfrom the body; and except for that ãtmã, he realises all worldly \nobjects to be asatya.  Following this, he beholds Paramãtmã within \nhis ãtmã and continuously thinks about Him. \n \n36.8 “With the exception of a person on whom Bhagvãn bestows His grace \n– regarding which nothing can be said – people may attempt \ncountless other means, but without resorting to these four methods, \na person will not be able to continuously engage his vrutti on \nBhagvãn.  Of course, continuously engaging the vrutti on Bhagvãn is \nan extremely difficult achievement.  It is only possible by those \nwhose good deeds from many lives have ripened.  For others, it is \nvery difficult, indeed.” \n \n36.9 Having described how to continuously engage the vrutti on Bhagvãn’s \nsvarup, Shreeji Mahãrãj added, “In this world, everyone talks of mãyã.  \nI have seen the characteristics of that mãyã as follows:  Love for \nanything other than Bhagvãn is itself mãyã.  In fact, the love a person \nhas towards his own body and his relatives and towards the person \nwho provides for his body, exceeds even the extreme love a person \nhas for the panch-vishays.  Therefore, a person who has eradicated \nlove for his body, his relations, and those who provide for his body is \nsaid to have risen above Bhagvãn’s mãyã.  In fact, a person who \neradicates love for everyone other than Bhagvãn develops love \ntowards Bhagvãn.  Then, when love for Bhagvãn is developed, his \nvrutti continuously remains on Bhagvãn.  When that is achieved, he \nhas nothing further to achieve; he has become fulfilled.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 36 || 169 || \nGADHADÃ II \n- 530 - \nGadhadã II – 37 \nEradicating A Svabhãv \n \n37.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Bhãdarvã vad 1 [21st September 1823], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda \noutside the west-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  \nHe was dressed entirely in white clothes.  At that time, a sabhã of \nparamhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n37.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “In the Geetã, it is said that even a \nperson possessing gnãn behaves according to his svabhãvs, and not \neven the strength of self-control mentioned in the shãstras is effective \nin such cases.  Then, how can such svabhãvs be eradicated?” \n \n37.3 All the munis thought over the question, but they were unable to \nanswer it. \n \n37.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “The answer to that is as follows:  When a \nsat-purush gives guidance on how to eradicate such svabhãvs, if a \nperson has total faith in those words; if he has deep love for the sat-\npurush giving the guidance; and if he accepts those words to be for \nhis own benefit no matter how painfully strong these sat-purush’s \nwords seem, then his svabhãvs will be eradicated.  Except for this, \nthere is no other method.  Therefore, regardless of how much \nBhagvãn or the sat-purush insults him for the purpose of eradicating \nhis svabhãvs, and regardless of the harsh words they may utter, a \nperson who wishes to eradicate his svabhãvs should not feel hurt in \nany way and should consider only the qualities of the person advising \nhim.  If a person behaves in this way, then that svabhãv, which \notherwise could not be eradicated in any way, is eradicated.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 37 || 170 || \n \nGADHADÃ II \n- 531 - \nGadhadã II – 38 \nMãnchã Bhakta And The Alchemist \n \n38.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Bhãdarvã vad 6 [26th September 1823], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \nlarge, cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã \nKhãchar's darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  At that time, a sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n38.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “If a worldly person were to come across \nsomeone who could grant him wealth or a son, he would immediately \ndevelop faith in that person.  However, a bhakta of Bhagvãn never \nhas faith in charms and spells, in witchcraft or in vulgar, dramatic \nperformances.  If he were to have faith in charms, spells, or \nwitchcraft, then even though he may be a satsangi, he should be \nconsidered to be half vimukh. \n \n38.3 “Having said this, there are not many true bhaktas of Bhagvãn.  \nNonetheless, Mãnchã Bhakta of Kãriyãni was indeed a true bhakta of \nBhagvãn.  Prior to joining the satsang, he was in the Mãrgi sect.  \nHowever, in no way did he lapse in his observance of the vow of \nnishkãm; instead, he remained a brahm-chãrya from his childhood. \n \n38.4 “Once, an alchemist was staying at his house.  After demonstrating \nhow he could transform copper into sliver, the alchemist told Mãnchã \nBhakta, ‘Because you are very charitable, I shall teach you this spell \nand show you how to transform copper into sliver’.  However, Mãnchã \nBhakta threatened him with a stick and drove him out of the village, \ntelling him, ‘I have no desire for anything except Bhagvãn’.  \nAfterwards, when Mãnchã Bhakta joined satsang, he became an \nekãntik bhakta of Bhagvãn.” \n \n38.5 Continuing, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “An ekãntik bhakta would firstly \npossess ãtmã-nishthã; secondly, he would possess vairãgya; thirdly, \nGADHADÃ II \n- 532 - \nhe would be strict in following dharma; and fourthly, he would \npossess profound bhakti for Shree Krishna Bhagvãn.  When such an \nekãntik bhakta abandons his physical body, he ‘merges’ into Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn, whereas a person who is not ekãntik ‘merges’ into \nBrahmã and the other devs or into Sankarshan, Aniruddha, or \nPradyumna.  However, without attaining the ekãntik state, a person \ncannot ‘merge’ into Shree Krishna Bhagvãn. \n \n38.6 “Such ‘merging’ should be understood as follows:  A person who is \nvery greedy is said to ‘merge’ into money; a person who is very \nlustful is said to ‘merge’ into the woman he is fond of; and when a \nperson who is very rich but childless receives a son, he is said to \n‘merge’ into his son.  In this way, a person should be known as having \n‘merged’ into whatever he is attached to.  However, this ‘merging’ is \nnot like that of water merging with water or like fire merging with \nfire. \n \n38.7 “If a bhakta has ‘merged’ into his ishta-dev, he would never develop \nlove for anything else except his ishta-dev.  In fact, he would \ncontinuously think of Him.  If he were forced to live without his ishta-\ndev, he would live life in days of deep misery; but, in no way would he \nbe happy.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 38 || 171 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 39 \nBehaving According To Natural Qualities \n \n39.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Bhãdarvã vad 10 [29th September 1823], \nShreeji Mahãrãj arrived at Lakshmi-Vãdi on horseback from Dada \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  There, He sat on a decorated bedstead \nthat had been placed on the platform.  He was dressed entirely in \nwhite clothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 533 - \n39.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please reveal to me the qualities which \nare natural to you – qualities which do not decrease even under the \ninfluence of unpleasant desh, kãl, kriyã, and sang.” \n \n39.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj then began Himself, “Here, let me first tell you the \nqualities that are natural to me.”  He then said, “Firstly, it is my \nnature that regardless of how much physical contact of the panch-\nvishays I encounter, I do not have any desire for them in my mind – \nnot even in my dreams. \n \n39.4 “Secondly, regardless of how much pravrutti I may be physically \ninvolved in, when I look within towards my ãtmã, all my vruttis \nwithdraw into my ãtmã – just like a tortoise withdraws its limbs – \nand I experience profound bliss. \n \n39.5 “Thirdly, I have a very strong belief that Bhagvãn possesses a svarup.  \nI believe that Shree Krishna Vãsudev resides in His Akshardhãm – \nwhich is full of chaitanya and full of divine light – and possesses an \neternal and definite svarup.  Bhagvãn is also the all-doer, since that \nwhich is nirãkãr can accomplish nothing.  In fact, my belief that \nBhagvãn possesses a svarup is so firm that even though I have read \nand heard many Vedãnt shãstras, my belief has not been changed. \n \n39.6 “Fourthly, if I come to know of any man or woman that is \npretentiously offering bhakti to Bhagvãn merely as an outward show, \nand that person is not a genuine bhakta of Bhagvãn, then my mind is \nnot pleased upon seeing such a person.  Also, I never feel comfortable \nwith that person, because my mind only becomes pleased when I see \na genuine bhakta of Bhagvãn, and I am only comfortable with such \npeople. \n \n39.7 “I have described to you these four qualities that are natural to me.  \nNow, all of you may tell me yours.” \n \n39.8 Then, the senior paramhans and bhaktas described the qualities they \npossessed.   \nGADHADÃ II \n- 534 - \n39.9 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “For those who are senior amongst you, \nthe observance of the vow of nishkãm is an absolute must.  It may be \nfine if a person has a deficiency in some other aspect, but firmness in \nnishkãm is absolutely essential, as the example set by the seniors is \nwhat is followed by everyone else.” \n \n39.10 After delivering this talk, Shreeji Mahãrãj returned to Dãdã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr, performed the ãrti, and joined in the ‘Nãrãyan’ dhun and \nprayers.  Then, a sabhã of all the sãdhus and bhaktas was held there. \n \n39.11 At that time, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked the senior paramhans, “I have \ngreatly explained the importance of the fifth and tenth skandhs of the \nShreemad Bhãgvat.  Now, I would like all of you to explain the \nfundamental principle of those two skandhs as you have come to \nunderstand it.” \n \n39.12 All the senior paramhans offered explanations according to their own \nunderstanding. \n \n39.13 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Here, allow me to tell you the \nfundamental principle of those two skandhs.  But first of all, what can \nbe called a fundamental principle?  Well, when a fundamental \nprinciple is explained to even the most learned scholars, scriptural \nreaders, or highly intelligent people, they would have to agree with it.  \nIn no way could they doubt, ‘This might not be so’.  That is what can \nbe called a fundamental principle. \n \n39.14 “Now, the fundamental principle of the tenth skandh is as follows: He \nwhom the Upanishads (Vedãnt) and the Shrutis and Smrutis describe \nas being brahm, luminous, the embodiment of gnãn, the essence, \nsubtle; and who is described as niranjan, kshetragna, the cause of all, \nParbrahm, Purushottam, Vãsudev, Vishnu, Nãrãyan, and nirgun – is \nthis pratyaksha svarup of Shree Krishna Vãsudev, the son of Vasudev.  \nTherefore, wherever there are passages containing shloks in the tenth \nskandh, the words of those shloks refer to this pratyaksha svarup of \nShree Krishna Bhagvãn; there is no mention of anyone more superior \nGADHADÃ II \n- 535 - \nto Shree Krishna Bhagvãn.  The tenth skandh also mentions that only \nShree Krishna Bhagvãn is the cause of the creation, sustenance and \ndestruction of the whole universe. \n \n39.15 “The greatness of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn is narrated in the fifth \nskandh.  Also mentioned are the many different svarups assumed by \nShree Krishna Bhagvãn in various khands for the sustenance of the \nworld and for the sake of bestowing bliss upon his bhaktas.  In \naddition, all those who abide by the niyams prescribed by Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn attain a great status, whereas those who do not \nabide by those niyams fall from their status, even if they are great.  It \nis also said that if a common person disobeys those niyams, he will \ncertainly fall back. \n \n39.16 “That same Shree Krishna Vãsudev, who as a child gave the \nspectacular darshan of the pratyaksha four-armed svarup to Vasudev \nand Devki, is in fact the svarup of the eternal Vãsudev. \n \n39.17 “Furthermore, that Shree Krishna Bhagvãn had behaved according to \ndharma, arth, and kãm.  All those who narrate or even listen to the \ncharitras of Bhagvãn in which He followed dharma, arth, and kãm, \nwill be released from all of their sins and will attain Akshardhãm.  \nAlso, the birth, actions, and murti of that Vãsudev Bhagvãn are all \ndivya.  In fact, and Vãsudev Bhagvãn alone is sarvopari. \n \n39.18 “This is the fundamental principle of those two skandhs.  Even those \nwho have attained the brahm-rup state, like Shukji, must also \nworship and offer bhakti to Shree Krishna Bhagvãn.  Also, as \nmentioned in the tenth skandh, even those like Shukji should narrate \nand listen to the charitras of Bhagvãn.  In fact, Shukji himself has said, \n \nparinishthitopi nairgunya uttam-shloka-leelayã \ngruheeta-chetã rãjarshe ãkhyãnam yad-adheetavãn \nO King (Parikshit)!  Despite being perfectly poised in the nirgun state, having \nbeen attracted by the leelãs of Bhagvãn, I (Shukdevji) studied the Shreemad \nBhãgvat. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 536 - \n39.19 “A person should also keep a firm belief regarding the svarup of that \nVãsudev Bhagvãn.  If a person has a firm belief of the svarup of \nBhagvãn, and if he happens to commit some sin, then he will be freed \nof that sin – because there is always some form of prãyshchit \nprescribed for committing a sin.  However, to realise Bhagvãn as \nnirãkãr is a sin much greater than even the five great sins.  There is \nno prãyshchit for that sin. \n \n39.20 “Conversely, if a person realises Bhagvãn to possess a sãkãr and has a \nfirm belief of this, then even if he happens to commit a sin, there is \nnothing to worry about.  By the grace of Bhagvãn, all of those sins will \nbe burnt and his jeev will attain Bhagvãn. \n \n39.21 “Therefore, a person should keep a firm belief of the svarup of \nBhagvãn and firmly worship Him.  This is my message to you.  So, \nplease remember these words firmly in your lives.” \n \n39.22 Having given this advice to everyone, Shreeji Mahãrãj departed to \nhave His meal. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 39 || 172 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 40 \nOffering One Extra Dandvat \n \n40.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Ãso vad 3 [22nd October, 1823], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was in His residence in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  \nAfter bathing, he put on white clothes, and sat upon His seat.  Then, \nafter completing His daily routine of performing pujã of Bhagvãn, He \nwas performing dandvats in the northern direction to Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn.  It so happened that on that day, He performed one dandvat \nmore than usual.   \n \n40.2 Noticing this, Shuk Muni asked, “Mahãrãj, why did you perform one \nextra dandvat today?” \nGADHADÃ II \n- 537 - \n40.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “Everyday, after bowing to Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn, I used to pray, ‘Mahãrãj, if any feelings of ‘I-ness’ and ‘my-\nness’ for this body and its relations exist, then please eradicate them’.  \nHowever, today the following thought occurred to me:  ‘No other sin \ncauses more misery to a person than when he somehow – knowingly or \nunknowingly – harms a bhakta of Bhagvãn by thought, word, or deed’.  \nTherefore, I performed one extra dandvat to make up for any mistake \nthat may have occurred of knowingly or unknowingly harming some \nbhakta of Bhagvãn by thought, word, or deed. \n \n40.4 “I have come to the conclusion that the extent of damage and misery \nincurred as a result of harming a bhakta of Bhagvãn is not incurred \nby any other sin.  On the other hand, there is no spiritual activity that \nbenefits a person and gives as much happiness as that of serving a \nbhakta of Bhagvãn by thought, word, and deed. \n \n40.5 “It is because of the influence of lobh, mãn, irshyã, and krodh that a \nperson harms a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  Only a person who does not \npossess these four inner enemies can respect a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  \nTherefore, a person who wishes to experience supreme happiness in \nthis very body and also experience supreme happiness after death \nshould never harm a bhakta of Bhagvãn by thought, word, or deed. \n \n40.6 “However, if a person does somehow harm a bhakta of Bhagvãn, then \nhe should verbally pray to him for forgiveness; and physically and \nmentally, he should perform dandvats before him and determine to \nnever harm him again.  However, he should not behave in such a way \nthat he performs dandvats after harming someone once, only to then \nharm him again and perform dandvats again. \n \n40.7 “So that you remember this fact daily, from today, all sãdhus and all \nbhaktas should observe the following vow:  After performing pujã of \nBhagvãn, a person should perform dandvats according to his daily \npractice.  After this, to make up for knowingly and unknowingly \nharming a bhakta of Bhagvãn during the day, by thought, word, or \nGADHADÃ II \n- 538 - \ndeed, he should perform one extra dandvat every day.  This is my \nãgnã; so please do abide by it.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 40 || 173 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 41 \nA Bone Is The Form Of Mãn \n \n41.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Kãrtik vad 11 [28th November, 1823], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a large decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  He was wearing garlands of yellow flowers around His neck, \nand tassels of yellow flowers had been inserted in His pãgh.  A sabhã \nof munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n41.2 Out of compassion, Shreeji Mahãrãj then began to preach to His \nbhaktas, saying, “When a person who wishes to worship Bhagvãn \nreceives an opportunity to serve Bhagvãn and His bhaktas, he should \nserve them considering it to be his extremely great fortune.  \nMoreover, he should do so only with bhakti, for the sake of pleasing \nBhagvãn and for his own kalyãn – not for the sake of receiving praise \nfrom others. \n \n41.3 “However, the nature of a person is such that he only enjoys doing \nthat which satisfies his pride.  Without that, he does not enjoy \nperforming even bhakti of Bhagvãn.  For example, a dog takes a dry \nbone to an isolated place to chew on.  As a result of the chewing, its \nmouth is grazed and the bone becomes covered in blood.  Then, \nlicking the bone, the dog becomes overjoyed.  But, little does the fool \nrealise, ‘The taste that I am enjoying is that of the blood from my own \nmouth’.  In the same way, even a bhakta of Bhagvãn is unable to \nabandon the bone (pride).  In fact, all the spiritual activities he \nGADHADÃ II \n- 539 - \nperforms are governed by pride; they are not performed for the sole \npurpose of pleasing Bhagvãn, while thinking of them as bhakti \ntowards Bhagvãn.  Moreover, of all the bhakti that he does offer to \nBhagvãn, he does so only when it nourishes his pride, but not for the \nsole purpose of pleasing Bhagvãn. \n \n41.4 “There must be very few bhaktas like Ratanji and Miyãji who offer \nbhakti to Bhagvãn solely for the purpose of pleasing Bhagvãn without \nany cravings for praise.  However, not everyone is capable of \nabandoning the taste of praise.” \n \n41.5 In reference to this, Muktãnand Swãmi recited a verse by Tulsidãs: \n \nkanak tajyo kãmini tajyo, tajyo dhãtuko sang \ntulsi laghu bhojan kari, jeeve mãn ke rang \nTulsi says:  he has abandoned women, wealth, and possessions. \nBut, he lives on praise alone, the greatest of all obsessions. \n \n41.6 Hearing this verse, Shreeji Mahãrãj added, “The enjoyment which a \nperson experiences from pride cannot be obtained from any other \nobject.  Therefore, amongst all bhaktas, a person who abandons pride \nand worships Bhagvãn should be known to be an extremely great \nbhakta.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 41 || 174 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 42 \nSagun And Nirgun Aspects Of Akshar \n  \n42.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Mãgshar vad 12 [29th December, 1823], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda \noutside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  \nHe was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 540 - \n \n42.2 Then, Bhagvadãnand Swãmi asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “In what way do \ncountless millions of brahmãnds dwell within each and every pore of \nBhagvãn?  Also, where in the brahmãnds do the avatãrs of Bhagvãn \noccur?” \n \n42.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “There are two aspects of Purushottam \nBhagvãn’s Akshardhãm.  The first is the sagun aspect, and the other is \nthe nirgun aspect.  On the other hand, Purushottam Nãrãyan cannot \nbe described as nirgun.  The distinction of sagun and nirgun applies \nonly to Akshar. \n \n42.4 “The nirgun aspect Akshar has an extremely subtle svarup, smaller \nthan even an atom, while the sagun svarup is much larger than even \nthe largest of objects.  Countless millions of brahmãnds dwell like \nmere atoms in each and every hair of that Akshar.  It is not that those \nbrahmãnds become small compared to Akshar; they still remain \nencircled by the eight barriers (jad prakruti).  But, it is because of the \nextreme vastness of Akshar that those brahmãnds appear so small.  \nTake Mount Girnãr as an example.  Compare to Mount Meru, it \nappears to be extremely small.  However, compared to Mount Lokã-\nLok, Mount Meru itself appears to be extremely small.  In the same \nway, the brahmãnds remain exactly as they are, but in comparison to \nthe extreme vastness of Akshar, they appear to be extremely small.  \nThis is why they are described as being like atoms. \n \n42.5 “Akshar-Brahm itself is like the sun; when the sun rises, all ten \ndirections can be determined in relation to it.  Akshardhãm is like \nthat; above, below, in all four sides of that Akshar – in all directions – \nare millions of brahmãnds. \n \n42.6 “Moreover, Bhagvãn forever remains present in that Akshardhãm; \nand His wish always prevails.  While remaining in Akshardhãm itself, \nHe takes birth in whatever svarup is required in whichever \nbrahmãnd.  For example, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn has only one svarup, \nGADHADÃ II \n- 541 - \nbut during the rãs-leelã he assumed as many svarups as there were \ngopis.  In the same way, Purushottam Bhagvãn takes birth in \nwhatever svarup is required in whichever brahmãnd – while at the \nsame time remaining in Akshardhãm.  Actually, He Himself forever \ndwells in Akshardhãm.  Wherever that svarup of Purushottam resides, \nis the very centre of Akshardhãm.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 42 || 175 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 43 \nBecoming Brahm-Svarup \n \n43.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Posh sud 4 [5th January, 1824], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was seated on a mattress with a large, \ncylindrical pillow at the residence of the bhaktas of Ayodhyã in Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him.  Premãnand Swãmi was singing kirtans to \nthe accompaniment of a sarodã. \n \n43.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Let us conduct a question-answer \ndiscussion.”  So, Shreeji Mahãrãj Himself asked, “A bhakta of Bhagvãn \nwho is gunãtit behaves only as the ãtmã, above the influence of the \nthree guns – above sattva-gun in the form of vairãgya, above rajo-gun \nin the form of desires for vishays, and above tamo-gun in the form of \npassiveness.  He has absolutely no thoughts, and experiences a state \nlike sushupti.  Now, does such a nirgun bhakta who behaves as the \nãtmã in this way have love for Bhagvãn, or not?  That is the question.” \n \n43.3 Muktãnand Swãmi replied, “A person who behaves as the ãtmã does \nhave love for Bhagvãn.” \n \n43.4 Hearing the reply, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Is the love of a bhakta, \nwho behaves as the ãtmã, of the same qualities as the ãtmã, or \ndifferent?” \nGADHADÃ II \n- 542 - \n43.5 Muktãnand Swãmi replied, “That love has the same qualities as the \nãtmã.” \n \n43.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “Regarding the love developed for \nBhagvãn while behaving as the ãtmã, Madhav-Ãchãrya, Nimbãrk, and \nVallabh-Ãchãrya have all described that love as brahm-svarup.  \nTherefore, only a person who has love for Bhagvãn having become \ngunãtit brahm-svarup.  Such is the principle of the great ãchãryas.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 43 || 176 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 44 \nThe Characteristics Of Religious And Demonic People \n \n44.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Posh sud 8 [9th January, 1824], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda outside the \neast-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was \ndressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n44.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked Muktãnand Swãmi, “When a person \nperceives an avgun in a bhakta, does that person perceive the same \namount of avgun in that bhakta as he had noticed previously, or does \nhe perceive more avgun?” \n \n44.3 Muktãnand Swãmi replied, “Apparently, he perceives the same \namount of avgun as he previously perceived.” \n \n44.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “You have missed the point of the \nquestion.  If he perceives exactly the same amount of avgun, then \nhow can you say that he has perceived an avgun?  In actual fact, it is \ndue to the influence of unpleasant desh, kãl, kriyã, and sang, that his \nintellect becomes spoiled; and that is why he perceives more avgun.  \nGADHADÃ II \n- 543 - \nIn this situation, a person should realise that the blemish of \nunpleasant circumstances has ruined his intellect. \n \n44.5 “Moreover, I personally feel, ‘If a person previously has kept the \ncompany of the great sant or has had the darshan of Bhagvãn, then he \nwill only perceive his own avgun but will never perceive avgun in any \nother bhakta of Bhagvãn’.  A person with such characteristics should \nbe known to be religious. \n \n44.6 “On the other hand, a person who is demonic never perceives even a \nsingle avgun within himself; instead, he perceives only avgun in other \nbhaktas.  A person with such an intellect should be known to be \ndemonic.  If such a demonic person happens to be in satsang, or if he \nstays in the company of sãdhus, he will be similar to Kãlnemi, Rãvan, \nand Rãhu; but, he will not be influenced by the company of sãdhus. \n \n44.7 “Therefore, a person who is a strict bhakta of Bhagvãn perceives only \nhis own avgun; he never notices the avgun of other bhaktas.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 44 || 177 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 45 \nThe Ãgnã Of Remaining Attentive \n \n45.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Posh vad 1 [17th January, 1824], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda outside the \neast-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was \ndressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n45.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “All of you munis, brahm-chãris, satsangi \ngrahasthas, pãrshads, and the bhaktas of Ayodhyã are said to be mine.  \nSo, if I was not attentive in having all of you behave accordingly, and \nGADHADÃ II \n- 544 - \nif you were to then behave waywardly, I would not be able to tolerate \nthis.  In actual fact, I do not want even the slightest imperfection to \nremain in those who are said to be mine.  However, you should also \nremain very attentive, because if you allow even a little carelessness, \nyour footing in satsang will not last. \n \n45.3 “Furthermore, as you are bhaktas of Bhagvãn, I do not wish to leave \nany form of improper svabhãvs within your hearts.  Also, I do not \nwish to allow any trace of any of Mãyã’s three gun, ten indriyas, ten \nprãns, four antah-karans, five bhuts, panch-vishays, and the devs of the \nfourteen loks to remain.  Instead, I wish to make all of you such that \nyou offer bhakti to Bhagvãn and realise your true svarup to be the \nãtmã, which is eternal and is free from all of these mãyik flaws.  In \nfact, I wish not to allow any influence of mãyã to remain within you.  \nIf all of your imperfections are not eradicated in this very lifetime, \nthen I will take you to Badrikãshram, where all of your worldly \ndesires will be burnt to ashes by performing tap; or I will take you to \nShvet-Dvip and burn all of your worldly desires to ashes by having \nyou perform tap with the niranna-muktas.  However, I do not wish to \nallow any love for anything except Bhagvãn to remain.  For this \nreason, all the bhaktas and munis should remain attentive.” \n \n45.4 Having delivered this talk, Shreeji Mahãrãj returned to His residence. \n \n45.5 Later, in the evening of that same day, Shreeji Mahãrãj held another \nsabhã.  After the ãrti was completed, He said, “By performing sãttvik \nkarmas, a person goes to Dev-Lok; by performing rãjas karmas, a \nperson goes to Mrutyu-Lok; and by performing tãmas karmas, a \nperson goes to the lower loks.  However, someone may doubt, ‘If by \nperforming rãjas karmas a person attains Mrutyu-Lok, then that \nsuggests that all those of Mrutyu-Lok should experience the same joys \nand miseries’.  So, the answer to this is that although there is only one \nparticular rajo-gun, countless types of distinctions are created within \nit due to the influence of differing factors, like desh and kãl.  \nTherefore, it is not the case that there is one certain type of rãjas \nGADHADÃ II \n- 545 - \nkarma.  In actual fact, the type of karmas performed varies according \nto the factors of desh, kãl, kriyã, and sang. \n \n45.6 “Having said this, if a person performs some karma which displeases \nthe sant of Bhagvãn’s or an avatãr of Bhagvãn, he will suffer miseries \nsimilar to those of Yampuri in this very body here in Mrutyu-Lok.  On \nthe other hand, if a person performs a karma by which Bhagvãn and \nHis bhaktas are pleased, then he will enjoy bliss similar to that of \nattaining Akshardhãm in this very body. \n \n45.7 “Furthermore, if a person were to displease Bhagvãn and His sant, \nthen despite the fact that he had performed such karmas that would \nhave led him to Svarg, all those karmas would be destroyed and he \nwould instead be sent to Narak.  Conversely, if a person were to \nperform a karma by which Bhagvãn and His sant are pleased, then \neven if he were destined to fall into Narak, all of his impure karmas \nwould be destroyed and he would instead attain Akshardhãm.  \nTherefore, a person who is wise should behave only in a way that \nwould please Bhagvãn and His bhaktas.  He should even advise all of \nhis relatives, ‘We should behave only in a way that would please \nBhagvãn and His sant, and in a way by which they would shower their \ngrace upon us’. \n \n45.8 “In fact, Agni must have also pleased Bhagvãn and His sant, because \nonly then would he have attained his light.  Surya, Chandra, and all \nothers who possess light, must also have pleased Bhagvãn and His \nsant by performing religious karmas, as only then would they have \nattained such light.  In fact, all of those who are happy in Dev-Lok and \nMrutyu-Lok must have pleased Bhagvãn and His sant, because it is by \ntheir grace that they are happy.   \n \n45.9 “Therefore, a person who aspires for the good of his own ãtmã \nshould observe the svadharma prescribed in the shãstras, and do only \nthat which pleases Bhagvãn and His sant.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 45 || 178 || \nGADHADÃ II \n- 546 - \nGadhadã II – 46 \nProgression and Regression Does Not Affect A Sat-Purush \n \n46.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Posh vad 11 [26th January 1824], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda outside the \nwest-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was \ndressed entirely in white clothes, and had covered Himself with a \nyellow rajãi made of chhint.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him.  Some of the sãdhus \nwere singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a jhãnjh and mrudang. \n \n46.2 After the singing concluded, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A sat-purush living \nin this world is not pleased or pained upon seeing the worldly \nprogress or regress of a person.  However, when someone’s mind \nfalls back from the path of Bhagvãn, he does become grieved.  After \nall, life is so short; and if a person’s afterlife is ruined, it would indeed \nbe a great loss for that person. \n \n46.3 “In fact, Bhagvãn assumes avatãrs upon earth for the purpose of \nestablishing dharma, and not simply for the establishment of the \ndharma of a person’s varna and ãshram.  After all, even the ãchãryas \nof pravrutti dharma, such as the Saptarshi, have established the \ndharma of the four varna and ãshrams.  However, Bhagvãn does not \nassume avatãrs solely for that purpose; He assumes avatãrs to \ndevelop the dharma of His ekãntik bhaktas. \n \n46.4 “For such ekãntik bhaktas, leaving the body is not considered to be \ndeath; for them, falling from that ekãntik dharma is true death.  This \noccurs when a dislike arises in the heart towards Bhagvãn or His \nsant.  That bhakta should then be known to have fallen from the \ndharma of ekãntik bhaktas.  For example, if he has fallen due to krodh, \nit should be known that he has received the body of a snake; and if he \nhas fallen due to kãm, it should be known that he has taken birth as \nan evil spirit or a demon. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 547 - \n46.5 “Nevertheless, despite having attained such bodies and having fallen \nfrom ekãntik dharma, those who observe dharma or perform tap will \nattain Dev-Lok due to their observance of dharma or their \nperformance of tap.  However, a person who has a dislike towards \nBhagvãn or His sant will certainly not attain the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  \nOn the other hand, even if a person has committed the five great sins, \nif he has not perceived an avgun in Bhagvãn or His sant, then his sins \nwill be burned, and he will dwell in the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  Therefore, \nto perceive avgun in Bhagvãn and His bhakta is a greater sin than \ncommitting the five great sins.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 46 || 179 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 47 \nThe Desire To Perform Bhakti After Becoming Brahm-Rup \n \n47.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Mahã vad 10 [24th February 1824], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda \noutside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  \nHe was dressed entirely in white clothes and had covered Himself \nwith a yellow rajãi made of chhint.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n47.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “If a person has a group of sãdhus staying \nwith him, and if he can sincerely look after them graciously, those \nsãdhus will happily stay with him.  However, if he does not know how \nto look after them, they will not stay with him. \n \n47.3 “Furthermore, if a sãdhu is eager to attain moksh, he would become \nincreasingly overjoyed when I do something that may upset him or \nwhen I criticise the vishays.  For example, Muktãnand Swãmi has \ncontracted tuberculosis, and so he is restricted from eating yoghurt, \nmilk, and any sweet or fried foods.  A wise person would think to \nhimself, ‘This disease has restricted all tasty food and drink; therefore I \nGADHADÃ II \n- 548 - \nwonder if I have actually attained the company of a great sãdhu in the \nappearance of tuberculosis!’  This is how a wise person would view \nthe situation.  This is because a person’s desires regarding the \ngenitals and the stomach are characteristics of an asat person.  \nHowever, tuberculosis is disease that removes both flaws.  Therefore, \na mumukshu should not feel hurt when a sat-purush, in the same way \nas that disease, criticises vishays. \n \n47.4 “Also, if a person is staying with a senior sãdhu due to the temptation \nof obtaining tasty food or drink, or due to the temptation of obtaining \nnice clothes, or due to the temptation of collecting objects that he \nlikes, then he should not be considered a sãdhu at all.  Instead, he \nshould be known to be an extremely wretched person and like a dog.  \nA person who has such corrupt intentions will ultimately fall from \nsatsang. \n \n47.5 “Furthermore, if someone should give a sãdhu a nice object, a person \nwho becomes jealous as well as the person who is greedy for the \npanch-vishays are both much worse than a person who has \ncommitted the five great sins.  Therefore, a person who is wise \nshould remain in the company of sãdhus and not have any impure \nintentions within.  After all, this sabhã is like the sabhã in \nBadrikãshram and Shvet-Dvip; if a person’s worldly desires are not \neradicated here, where else will he be able to eradicate them? \n \n47.6 “Moreover, our jeevs have previously indulged in the panch-vishays \nthrough countless bodies, as devs and humans.  Nevertheless, we \nhave not been happy with those vishays.  Therefore, now that we are \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn, indulging in the vishays for a further year, or two \nyears, or maybe even five years will still not fulfil us.  It is as if the \nearth has been split down to Pãtãl, and we begin to fill it with water, \nit can never be filled.  Similarly, the indriyas have never become \nsatisfied by the vishays, and they never will be.  So, a person should \neradicate his attachment to the vishays.  Furthermore, he should \nconsider the qualities of the sãdhu who speaks to him harshly and \nGADHADÃ II \n- 549 - \nshould not think unkindly of him.  This is explained in the following \nkirtan composed by Muktãnand Swãmi: ‘Shuli Upar Shayan Karãve \nToy Sãdhu-Ne Sange Rahiye Re...’ – a person should remain in the \ncompany of sãdhus, even if he has to suffer the pain of a shuli.  \nTherefore, a person should take hold of this opportunity and die only \nafter eradicating his impure desires; he should not die with his \nimpure desires still remaining. \n \n47.7 “Having said this though, a person should keep the following desire: \n‘After leaving this body, I want to become brahm-rup like Nãrad, the \nSanakãdik, and Shukji, and offer bhakti to Bhagvãn’ .  During this \nprocess, even if he has to go to Brahm-Lok or Indra-Lok, there is \nnothing to worry about.  For example, if a person goes to answer the \ncall of nature, and then falls headfirst into the gutter, he should take a \nbath and become pure again; he should not remain in the filth.  \nSimilarly, if a person has pure desires and as a result attains Brahm-\nLok or Indra-Lok, he should think, ‘I have fallen headfirst into the \ngutter’.  Thinking in this way, he should discard the pleasures of \nBrahm-Lok and Indra-Lok using the strength of his pure desires and \nmake his way to the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  He should be determined not \nto stop anywhere in between. \n \n47.8 “Also, just as the grahasthas or tyãgis serve us, we should also realise \ntheir greatness.  For example, Mulji Brahm-Chãri realises my \ngreatness and serves me.  In the same way, I realise his greatness.  \nTherefore, as the grahasthas serve us by providing food and clothes, \nwe should also realize their greatness and serve them by preaching \nto them.  In this way, we should develop friendship among bhaktas of \nBhagvãn by realising the greatness of each other.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 47 || 180 || \n \n \nGADHADÃ II \n- 550 - \nGadhadã II – 48 \n‘Vandu Sahajãnand’  \nTaking Birth In The Company Of Sant \n \n \n \n48.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Mahã vad 14 [28th February 1824], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda \noutside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  \nHe was dressed entirely in white clothes and was wearing new, white \nkanthis made from tulsi beads, around His neck.  In addition to this, \ntassels of yellow flowers decorated His pãgh, and garlands of flowers \nwere hanging around His neck.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.  \n \n48.2 In the sabhã, Premãnand Swãmi was singing ‘Vandu Sahajãnand Ras \nRup, Anupam Sãr-Ne Re Lol...’ – kirtans useful for dhyãn.  After he had \nfinished singing, Shreeji Mahãrãj commented, “The kirtans you sang \nwere very wonderful.  After listening to them I thought in my mind, \n‘Since this sãdhu thinks about Bhagvãn’s svarup in this way, let me get \nup and perform dhyãn before him’. \n \n48.3 “If a person is able to think about Bhagvãn in his antah-karans in this \nway, and if he were to die while still holding such a desire for \nBhagvãn, he would definitely not have to take another birth.  If he \nengages in such dhyãn of Bhagvãn, he has certainly attained \nAkshardhãm while alive.  In addition, he can be said to be in the \nprocess of becoming a niranna-mukta just like the niranna-muktas in \nShvet-Dvip.  Such a person performs the bodily activities that are \nnecessary without effort.  In fact, a person who is able to think about \nBhagvãn’s svarup like this has become fulfilled and has nothing more \nleft to achieve. \n \n48.4 “On the other hand, if a person dies while thinking about things other \nthan Bhagvãn, there will be no end to his miseries for countless \nmillions of years.  So, now that such an opportunity has arisen, a \nperson should seize it and, after discarding any thoughts about \nobjects other than Bhagvãn, should think about His svarup only. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 551 - \n48.5 “However, if a person is unable to think about Bhagvãn’s svarup, he \nshould remain in the company of a sãdhu who possesses dharma, \ngnãn, vairãgya, and bhakti.  As for myself, I have only this desire \nwithin: ‘When I abandon this body, although there will be no reason for \nme to take birth again, I feel in my heart that I should make a reason \nand take birth in the company of such sãdhus’.  This is all I wish for. \n \n48.6 “However, if a person is able to think about Bhagvãn as described in \nthe above kirtan, then he is freed from the bondage of Kãl, karma, and \nMãyã.  In fact, regardless of the family in which he person happens to \nbe born, his parents should also be considered to be fulfilled.  \nConversely, a person who thinks about the vishays, and does not \nthink of Bhagvãn, should be considered as being totally lost. \n \n48.7 “After all, regardless of the life-form in which a person takes birth, he \nwill be able to have a wife, a son, and possessions such as wealth and \nother objects.  However, the company of a sãdhu who is knower of \nbrahm, as well as the direct darshan and thought of Shree Vãsudev \nBhagvãn are extremely rare.  Therefore, there is no greater \nadvantage of possessing this human body than being able to \nconstantly think about Bhagvãn in the heart – just as a person \nengrossed in the vishays constantly think about them in the antah-\nkarans.  Such a person is also the greatest amongst all bhaktas of \nBhagvãn.  Even if he does indulge in the panch-vishays, all would be \nrelated only to Bhagvãn.  His ears wish to continuously listen to talks \nrelated to Bhagvãn; his skin wishes to touch Bhagvãn; his eyes with \nto have the darshan of Bhagvãn and His sant; his tongue wishes to \ntaste the prasãd  of Bhagvãn; and his nose wishes to smell the \nfragrance of flowers and tulsi which have been offered to Bhagvãn.  \nApart from Bhagvãn, he considers nothing else to be a source of \nhappiness.  A person who behaves in this way, can be called an \nekãntik bhakta of Bhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 48 || 181 || \nGADHADÃ II \n- 552 - \nGadhadã II – 49 \nDifferences Between Bhagvãn’s Svarup And Mãyik Svarups \n \n49.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Fãgan sud 2 [1st March 1824], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a large, \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on \nthe veranda outside the west-facing medi in front of the mandir of \nShree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.

However, those \nwho are ignorant and those who are utter fools consider Bhagvãn’s \nsvarup and mãyik svarups to be the same.  Those who see mãyik \nsvarups and those who think about mãyik svarups spend countless \nmillions of years wandering in the cycle of births and deaths.  In the \ncomparison, those who do the darshan of Bhagvãn’s svarup and those \nwho think about it, escape from the bondage of Kãl, karma, and, \nMãyã; attain Akshardhãm; and become pãrshads of Bhagvãn.

I have also forever attached myself with \nundying love to Purushottam Bhagvãn – who possesses a definite \nsvarup – and to His bhaktas dwelling in the radiant Akshardhãm.  In \nfact, I have no love for anything other than them.  This is what I \nconstantly experience. \n \n50.3 “Outwardly, I do not make a display of the intensity of my tyãg.  \nHowever, when I look into my heart and towards the hearts of other \nbhaktas, even the senior paramhans and senior sãnkhya-yogi  women \nall seem to have some trace of the world remaining – whereas \nworldly desires never arise in my heart; not even in my dreams.  It \nalso seems to me that no one is capable of making me falter from my \nbhakti towards Bhagvãn and His bhaktas. \n \n50.4 “In addition, even before a person had been graced with the \nattainment of Bhagvãn, Kãl (a power of Bhagvãn) was unable to \ndestroy the jeev; karmas were unable to destroy the jeev; not even \nMãyã was able to absorb the jeev within itself.  So, having attained \nBhagvãn, why should a person worry about Kãl, karma, and Mãyã?  \nBearing this in mind, I have become determined that I do not want to \ndevelop love for anyone except Bhagvãn and His bhaktas. \n \n50.5 “Furthermore, I do not wish to leave any trace of the world in the \nhearts of whosoever keeps my company.  This is because I only get \nalong with those whose determination is similar to mine.  However, if \nGADHADÃ II \n- 554 - \na person has desires for worldly pleasures, that even if I try to \ndevelop love for that person, I cannot do so.  Therefore, only those \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn who are free of worldly desires are dear to me.  \nWhat I have just told you is my personal principle.” \n \n50.6 In this way, Shreeji Mahãrãj talked to His bhaktas for the sake of their \nenlightenment. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 50 || 183 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 51 \nThe Characteristics Of A Person Who Behaves As The Ãtmã \n \n51.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on the night of Chaitra vad 9 [22nd April \n1824], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress \nwith a large, cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the south-facing rooms of Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n51.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked the paramhans, “Often, when the jeev \nenters sushupti, it experiences profound peace, whereas at other \ntimes, even when it enters sushupti, its restlessness does not subside.  \nWhat is the reason for this?  That is my question.” \n \n51.3 The senior paramhans attempted to answer the question, but were \nunable to give a precise answer. \n \n51.4 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “That is due to the increase of the force \nof rajo-gun.  So, even during the state of sushupti, the disturbance of \nrajo-gun joins with tamo-gun.  As a result, a person experiences a \nfeeling of restlessness even within sushupti.  Therefore, as long as the \ninfluence of the gun remains within a person, he will never \nGADHADÃ II \n- 555 - \nexperience happiness; he only becomes happy when he behaves as \nthe ãtmã.” \n \n51.5 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “What are the characteristics of \nsomeone who behaves as the ãtmã?” \n \n51.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “No one is said to be as powerful as Shiv and \nBrahmã.  In fact, they are the gurus of even Nãrad; it is difficult for \nothers to behave as they do – as brahm-svarup.  Having said that, \nwhen the eight factors of desh, kãl, kriyã, sang, dhyãn, mantra, dikshã, \nand shãstra became unpleasant, the harmful influence caused great \ndistress in the hearts of even Shiv and Brahmã.  Therefore, regardless \nof how nirgun a person may be, or even if he behaves as the ãtmã, if \nhe encounters unpleasant circumstances, he will most certainly \nexperience distress within.  So, no one can ever become happy by \ndisobeying the disciplines laid down by the great sant. \n \n51.7 “For this reason, all tyãgis should abide by the dharma of tyãgis, all \ngrahasthas should abide by the dharma of grahasthas, and all women \nshould abide by the dharma of women.  Even in this, a person will not \nbecome happy if he behaves less than what is prescribed; nor will he \nbecome happy by behaving beyond what is prescribed.  After all, the \ndharma prescribed in shãstras has been written exactly as Bhagvãn \nhas narrated; therefore, there can be no discrepancy in it.  Moreover, \nthey are prescribed in such a way that they are easy to observe.  \nTherefore, if a person observes too much or too little, he will \ncertainly become unhappy. \n \n51.8 “So, only a person who follows the commands of a sat-purush can be \nsaid to be under the influence of pleasant circumstances.  To deviate \nfrom those commands is the very definition of unpleasant \ncircumstances.  Therefore, only a person who follows the commands \nof a sat-purush is behaving as the ãtmã.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 51 || 184 || \nGADHADÃ II \n- 556 - \nGadhadã II – 52 \nThat Which Is Appropriate For A Tyãgi And Grahastha \nLeave Irshyã And Perform Bhakti With Shraddhã \n \n52.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Chaitra vad 11 [24th April 1824], Shreeji \nMahãrãj arrived at Lakshmi-Vãdi on horseback from Dãdã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Gadhadã.  He sat on a square platform and was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  He was also wearing a garland of flowers \naround His neck, and a tassel of flowers decorated His pãgh.  A sabhã \nof munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him.  Some of the munis were singing kirtans to the \naccompaniment of a jhãnjh and mrudang. \n \n52.2 After the munis had finished singing, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “I wish to \nspeak now, so please listen.  In this world, the path of a tyãgi and the \npath of a grahastha are both different.  The path of a grahastha is not \nappropriate for a tyãgi, and the path of a tyãgi is not appropriate for a \ngrahastha.  A person who is wise will realise this, but others will not. \n \n52.3 “Now, I shall explain the distinctions.  Wealth and property; \nelephants and horses; cow and buffaloes; houses and mansions; a \nwife and children; and lavish clothes and jewellery are all suitable for \na grahastha.  However, to live in the forest; to keep no clothes except \na loincloth; to wear a hat on his head; to shave off his hair, beard, and \nmoustache; to wear saffron-coloured clothes; and to tolerate \nsomeone swearing or throwing dust at him are most suitable for a \ntyãgi.  However, although these are suitable for a tyãgi, they are in \nfact inappropriate for a grahastha.  Therefore, a person who has \nabandoned the world and become a tyãgi should think, ‘Which \nãshram do I belong to?’  A wise person should think about this; he \nshould not stray onto some inappropriate path like a fool. \n \n52.4 “Moreover, if a wise person is disciplined by someone, he would in \nturn consider his qualities.  On the other hand, if someone offers \nGADHADÃ II \n- 557 - \nsome useful advice to a fool, the fool would be offended.  In that \nrespect, Mulji Brahm-Chãri and Ratanji are never offended; that is \nwhy I get along very well with them. \n \n52.5 “Also, I like a person who performs sevã with shraddhã.  Conversely, \nif someone who does not have shraddhã were to bring me a meal, I \nwould not like the food; or if they were to bring some clothes, I would \nnot like to wear them; or if they were to perform my pujã, I would not \nlike that pujã.  However, if someone offers something with shraddhã, \nI like it very much. \n \n52.6 “Furthermore, even if someone offers bhakti with shraddhã, if he \nbecomes jealous of someone else who comes to offer bhakti, then I do \nnot like that.  Therefore, I very much prefer a person who offers \nbhakti with shraddhã and without jealousy.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 52 || 185 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 53 \nNot Being Able To Perceive Avgun  \n \n53.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Vaishãkh sud 5 [3rd May 1824], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting upon a mattress with a large, \ncylindrical pillow in His residence in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, \nas well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n53.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The characteristics of moh as described \nin the shãstras are as follows:  When moh pervades a person’s heart, \nhe simply cannot perceive his own avgun.  Therefore, for a person \nnot to perceive his own avgun is the very definition of delusion. \n \n53.3 “Moreover, everyone has extreme pride of the wisdom that they \npossess, but they do not think, ‘I do not even know anything about my \nown jeev.  Is the jeev within this body black, or is it white?  Is it long, or \nGADHADÃ II \n- 558 - \nis it short?’  They know nothing about their own jeev, yet they find \navgun in the great sant or in Bhagvãn.  They feel, ‘Although He is a \ngreat sant or Bhagvãn, this much He is not doing properly’.  Though \nthey find avgun in this way, little do the fools realise that Bhagvãn \nsees all the jeevs and ishvars who dwell in the countless millions of \nbrahmãnds as clearly as He sees a drop of water in His palm.  He is \nalso the supporter of countless millions of brahmãnds; He is the \nhusband of Lakshmi; and He is the creator, sustainer, and destroyer \nof countless millions of brahmãnds.  Even Shesh, Shãrada, Brahmã, \nand other devs are unable to comprehend the extent of His greatness.  \nIn fact, even the Veds describe His glory as ‘neti neti’ implying that \nthe glory of Bhagvãn is unparalleled. \n \n53.4 “Therefore, a person who perceives avgun either in Bhagvãn’s \ncharitras or in His understanding should be known to be a vimukh \nand a sinner.  In fact, he should be considered to be the king of all \nfools.  The understanding of Bhagvãn and His bhaktas is beyond this \nworld.  Then, how can a person who believes his self to be the body \npossibly comprehend it? \n \n53.5 “So, it is simply out of foolishness that a person perceives flaws in \nBhagvãn and His bhaktas and therefore falls from the path of \nBhagvãn; but Bhagvãn’s true bhakta, the sat-purush, continues to act \nin a alokik way.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 53 || 186 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 54 \nSatsang Is The Greatest Spiritual Activity \n \n54.1 In the Samvat year 1880, in the afternoon on Jyeshth sud 7 [3rd June \n1824], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj arrived at Lakshmi-Vãdi \non horseback from Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  After riding \nthe horse for quite some time, He sat down on a square platform.  He \nGADHADÃ II \n- 559 - \nwas dressed entirely in white clothes.

A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n54.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked the munis, “In the twelfth chapter of the \neleventh skandh of Shreemad Bhãgvat, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn has \nsaid to Uddhav, ‘I am not as pleased by ashtãng-yog, sãnkhya, tyãg, \nvrats, yagna, tap, and yãtrã, as I am pleased by satsang’.  This is what \nBhagvãn has said.  This implies that of all spiritual activities, satsang \nis the greatest.  However, what are the characteristics of a person \nwho regards satsang as the greatest spiritual activity?” \n \n54.3 The munis answered according to their understanding, but none \ncould give a precise answer. \n \n54.4 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A person who regards satsang as the \ngreatest spiritual activity is deeply attached only to the sant of \nBhagvãn.  For example, if a king who is childless receives a son in old \nage, then even if that son swears at the king or misbehaves, like by \npulling his moustache, the king would not find faults in him.  Even if \nthe son hits another child or causes problems in the village, still the \nking would never attribute faults to his child.  This is because the \nking is profoundly attached to his son.  Likewise, only a person who \ndevelops such deep attachment for the bhaktas of Bhagvãn has \nrealised satsang to be the most kalyãn-kãri of all spiritual activities.  \nThis fact has been described in the Shreemad Bhãgvat: \n \nyasyãtmã-buddhiha kunape tri-dhãtuke svadheeha kalatradishu bhauma iyadheeha \nyat-teertha-buddhiha salile na karhichij-janeshva-bhigneshu sa eva gokharaha \nIf a person regards the body to be his own self; regards his wife and children to \nbe his own; regards the murtis of Bhagvãn made from earth to be respected; \nand regards water to be sacred like a place of pilgrimage, but does not regard \nthe enlightened bhakta of Bhagvãn in this way, then he is the most disgraceful \nof all animals, a wild donkey. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 560 - \n“This verse has stated the fact appropriately.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 54 || 185 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 55 \nPerform The Nine Types Of Bhakti After Becoming Brahm-Rup \nA Goldsmith’s Workshop \n \n55.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Jyeshth sud 11 [7th June 1824], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a large decorate bedstead \non the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Gadhadã.  He had tied a golden-bordered, white moliyu \nfrom Navãnagar around His head.  He was wearing a white khes and \nhad covered Himself with a white pachhedi.  A sabhã of munis, as well \nas haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.  Some \nof the munis were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a jhãnjh \nand mrudang. \n \n55.2 After the munis had finished singing the kirtans, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, \n“Just as a person possesses some sort of strength today, he must also \nhave had some trace of it before joining satsang.  Therefore, today I \nwould like all of you to describe whatever type of strength you have.  \nTo begin, I shall describe the type of strength I have, so please listen. \n \n55.3 “Even when I was a child, I very much enjoyed going to mandirs for \ndarshan, listening to kathãs, keeping the company of sãdhus, and \ngoing on yãtrã.  Then, when I left my home, I did not even like to keep \nclothes.  In fact, I like to stay only in the forest, and I was not the least \nbit afraid.  Even when I came across large snakes, lions, elephants, \nand countless other types of animals in the forest, there was not the \nslightest fear of dying in my heart.  In this way, I always remained \nfearless in the dense forest.  Thereafter, after travelling to holy places \nof pilgrimage, I met Rãmãnand Swãmi.  Only after Rãmãnand Swãmi \npassed away did I begin to keep a little fear; and that was for the sake \nof satsang. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 561 - \n55.4 “However, the following thought is constantly in my mind:  When a \nperson is laid down on his death-bed with death waiting, everyone \nloses their self-interest in that person.  The mind of the person who is \ndying also becomes dejected from worldly life.  In the same way, I \nalso constantly feel as if death is waiting at this moment for me, as \nwell as for others.  In fact, I constantly regard each and every worldly \nobject to be perishable and worthless.  Never do I make any \ndistinctions such as, ‘This is a nice object, and this is a bad object’.  All \nworldly objects appear the same to me.  For example, when \nconsidering the hairs of the armpit, which can be considered good \nand which bad?  Good or bad, they are all the same.  Similarly, all \nworldly objects appear the same to me. \n \n55.5 “If I do compliment or criticise something, it is only to please the \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn.  When I say things such as, ‘This is delicious food’, \nor ‘These are nice clothes’, or ‘This is beautiful jewellery’, or ‘This is a \npleasant house’, or ‘This is a fine horse’, or ‘This is a beautiful flower’, it \nis only to please that particular bhakta.  In fact, all of my activities are \nfor the sake of the bhaktas of Bhagvãn; there is not a single activity \nwhich I perform for my own personal enjoyment.” \n \n55.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “The mind of an ekãntik bhakta of Bhagvãn \nthinks of only the svarup of Bhagvãn; his mouth sings only the praises \nof Bhagvãn; his hands engage only in the sevã of Bhagvãn and His \nbhaktas; and his ears listen only to the praises of Bhagvãn.  In this \nway, I am able to perform all my activities only after realising them to \nbe a form of bhakti to Bhagvãn.  Besides the bhakti of Bhagvãn, my \nmind is indifferent to everything else.  For example, if the only son of \na king dies when the king reaches the age of sixty or seventy, the king \nwould become disinterested in all things.  In the same way, I \nconstantly remain disinterested while eating, drinking, mounting a \nhorse, and even when I am pleased or displeased. \n \n55.7 “In addition, a thought also remains within my heart that I am the \nãtmã, distinct from the body; I am not like this body.  Also, my mind \nGADHADÃ II \n- 562 - \nis always cautious, for fear that a portion of mãyã in the form of rajo-\ngun and tamo-gun will infiltrate my ãtmã!  In fact, I am constantly \nattentive of that. \n \n55.8 “Now, consider the following analogy of a goldsmith’s workshop:  If a \nperson takes some pure, twenty-four-carat gold to the goldsmith’s \nworkshop, but takes his eyes off of it for even a moment, the \ngoldsmith will extract some of the gold and alloy some silver in its \nplace.  Similarly, consider the goldsmith’s workshop to be the heart \nand the goldsmith to be mãyã.  While the goldsmith is sitting within \nhis workshop (heart), he is continuously hammering away with his \nhammer of desires.  Even his wife and children secretly steal some \ngold if they can get their hands on it.  Consider the indriyas and \nantah-karans to be the wife and children of the goldsmith (mãyã); it \nis they who add silver (three gun, attachment to the panch-vishays, \nthe belief that he is body, and that he has kãm, krodh, and lobh) into \nthe gold (chaitanya).  They also extract some gold (gun, such as \ndharma, bhakti, gnãn, and vairãgya). \n \n55.9 \n“When some gold is extracted and sliver is mixed in its place, the \noriginal gold diminishes in purity to become eighteen-carat gold.  It \ncan be purified again only after melting.  Therefore, the silver of rajo-\ngun and tamo-gun, which has been mixed into the jeev, should be \nfiltered out.  Then, the pure ãtmã (gold) will remain, and no other \nimpurities of mãyã will be left.  This is the thought in which I remain \nengrossed, day and night. \n \n55.10 “I have therefore described my strength to you.  Now, in the same \nway, please describe your strengths to me.” \n \n55.11 Then, the sãdhus said, “Mahãrãj, in no way can there be any \nimpurities of mãyã in you, as you are divya.  The talk you have just \ndelivered also describes our strength; and the thought that you have \nmentioned is actually what all of us should develop in our lives.” \nGADHADÃ II \n- 563 - \n55.12 Having delivered this talk, Shreeji Mahãrãj bid “Jay Sachidãnand” to \nall and returned to His residence. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 55 || 188 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 56 \nLove Only For Bhagvãn \n \n56.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Ashãdh sud 5 [1st July 1824], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a large, \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on \nthe veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr \nin Gadhadã.

Some of the sãdhus were singing kirtans to the \naccompaniment of a dukad and sarodã. \n \n56.2 After the singing had finished, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Upon hearing \nthese kirtans, my ãtmã delved into deep thought, from which I have \nconcluded that deep love for Bhagvãn is a great thing.  Then, I \nremembered Gopãlãnand Swãmi and all the bhaktas who have deep \nlove for Bhagvãn; and I could see their love towards Bhagvãn in all of \ntheir antah-karans and jeevs.  Then, I examined my own ãtmã, and it \nappeared to me that others do not seem to have as much love for \nBhagvãn as I do.  After all, if they were to encounter unpleasant \ncircumstances, then even though they are great, their mind would at \nleast be slightly affected.  Therefore, I felt that ultimately their \nfoundation appears to be weak.  In fact, if they were to encounter \nextremely unpleasant circumstances, their love for Bhagvãn would \nnot remain stable at all. \n \n56.3 “So, after examining everyone, it seems to me that my position is \nbetter; regardless of the extent of unpleasant circumstances that I \nmay encounter, in no way will my antah-karans ever be affected.  If a \nGADHADÃ II \n- 564 - \nperson’s love for Bhagvãn is true, he never develops love for anything \nother than Bhagvãn.  In fact, the essence of all shãstras is simply this:  \nBhagvãn is the sole source of eternal bliss and the supreme essence \nof everything.  Excluding Bhagvãn, all other objects are absolutely \nworthless and totally insignificant. \n \n56.4 “If a person does have as much love for other objects as he does for \nBhagvãn, then his foundation is indeed very weak.  Consider the \nanalogy of a piece of lightly dyed cloth.  It may look very nice initially, \nbut if water happens to fall on it, and it is then put out to dry in the \nsun, then it becomes useless.  It would become so useless that it \nwould not even remain like a white piece of cloth.  In the same way, \nwhen a person who has affection for the panch-vishays encounters \nevil company, a person can never be certain about him. \n \n56.5 “Therefore, to please Bhagvãn, a bhakta should totally discard the \npanch-vishays.  He should also abandon any affection for objects \nwhich may obstruct his love for Bhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 56 || 189 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 57 \nA ‘Cat-Like’ Bhakta \n \n57.1 In the Samvat year 1881, during the even ãrti on Ashãdh sud 6 [2nd \nJuly 1824], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a \ndecorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of \nDãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  A few torches had been lit.  \nTassels made of flowers were hanging from the white pãgh that had \nbeen tied around His head.  He was wearing a white khes and had \ncovered Himself with a white chãdar.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well \nas haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him in a \nsabhã.  Some of the sãdhus were singing kirtans to the \naccompaniment of a dukad and sarodã. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 565 - \n57.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please listen, I wish to speak to all of you.  \nWhen you were singing kirtans, and as I was listening to them, a \nthought occurred to me, which I shall now share with you.  If a \nperson wants to love Bhagvãn, he should love Him while believing \nhimself to be the pure ãtmã.  What is that ãtmã like?  Well, within it \nthere are no obstructions either of Mãyã or the entities evolved from \nMãyã (the three gun, the body, the indriyas, and the antah-karans).  \nWhatever obstructions seem to be in the ãtmã are due to ignorance.  \nHowever, no obstructions of any form remain in a person who has \ntotally dispelled them through gnãn and vairãgya.  However, to \nbehave as the ãtmã does not mean to believe himself to be brahm and \nact waywardly.  In actual fact, the purpose of behaving as the ãtmã is \nto realise, ‘I am the ãtmã, and there are obstructions of Mãyã within \nme.  If that is so, how can there be even the slightest trace of Mãyã in \nParamãtmã Nãrãyan Vãsudev, who is beyond the ãtmã?’  For this \nreason, the quality of ãtmã-nishthã should be firmly developed so \nthat a person does not perceive any fault in Bhagvãn. \n \n57.3 “Then, keeping his thought in the midst of the light of the ãtmã, he \nshould destroy anything that tries to disturb him from behaving as \nthe ãtmã.  For example, when a lizard comes near the light of an oil \nlamp, it kills any insect that comes near the light.  In the same way, \nthe thought that rests within the light of the ãtmã destroys \neverything apart from the ãtmã. \n \n57.4 “Furthermore, if a person truly loves Bhagvãn, he would never \ndevelop love for anything else.  If there is an object that appears to be \ndearer to him than Bhagvãn, he would completely discard it.  That is \ntrue tyãg.  He would discard that object irrespective of whether it is a \nsignificant object or an insignificant object – only that is called tyãg.  \nOn the other hand, if a person can outwardly give up many other \nthings but cannot discard an object that obstructs him in \nworshipping Bhagvãn, his tyãg is useless. \n \nGADHADÃ II \n- 566 - \n57.5 “Also, do not think that only appealing objects obstruct a person’s \nworship of Bhagvãn and insignificant objects do not.  After all, the \nvery nature of the jeev is such that some people prefer sweet items, \nsome prefer salty items, some prefer sour items, and some prefer \nbitter items.  Therefore, it is the petty mentality of the jeev that it \nkeeps even the most insignificant objects dearer to it than Bhagvãn.  \nHowever, when a person considers the greatness of Bhagvãn, no such \nobject can compare to even a millionth of a fraction of His greatness. \n \n57.6 “If a person has developed love for Bhagvãn having thoroughly \nrealised Bhagvãn in this way, he would not develop love towards any \nworldly object, such as the body, and the brahmãnd.  Instead, all \nworldly objects would become insignificant to him.  After all, it was \nwhen Chitraketu Rãjã thoroughly realised the greatness of Bhagvãn \nthat he abandoned his ten million wives.  He even abandoned his \nempire, which spanned across the entire country.  He ultimately \nrealised, ‘Of what value is the pleasure of ten million women before the \nbliss of Bhagvãn?  Of what value are the pleasures of an empire \nspanning the entire country?  Of what value are the pleasures of the lok \nof Indra and the lok of Brahmã?’ \n \n57.7 “In contrast, a person who has love for some objects other than such \na great Bhagvãn possesses a very petty mentality.  Just as a dog \ndeprives pleasure from taking a dry bone to some isolated place and \nthen licking it, in the same way, a foolish person believes that there \nare pleasures in such miseries, and therefore develops love for \nworthless objects.  If a bhakta of Bhagvãn does have more love for \nsome object than he has for Bhagvãn, then he is nothing but a ‘cat-\nlike’ (deceitful) bhakta.  On the other hand, a true bhakta of Bhagvãn \nwould definitely not hold anything dearer to him than Bhagvãn.” \n \n57.8 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “A bhakta of Bhagvãn who possesses gnãn, \nvairãgya, bhakti, and dharma realises, ‘A person who is brave and who \nwalks boldly towards his enemy at the time of battle is indeed truly \nGADHADÃ II \n- 567 - \nbrave.  Conversely, it is pointless when a person who is brave is not \nutilised in battle, just like wealth that is not spent.  Similarly, since I \nhave attained Bhagvãn, if I do not talk about kalyãn to those who keep \nmy company, then of what use is my gnãn?’  Bearing this in mind, he \nwould not have any cowardice in talking about Bhagvãn – even if \nsome opposition were to arise regarding his preaching.” \n \n57.9 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj requested the singing of three \nverses written by Tulsidãs: ‘Jãki Lagan Rãmso Nahi...’, ‘Ehi Kahyo Sunu \nVed Chahu...’, and ‘Jãku Priya Na Rãm Vaidehi...’. \n \n57.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj then added, “We should live according to the words \nmentioned in these verses.  While doing so, if some deficiency \nremains, and if a person were to die at that time, he will still not enter \nthe cycle of births and deaths, nor will he become a ghost.  In fact, at \nthe very worst, he will join the ranks of Indra or Brahma; his fate will \nnot be any worse than that.  Therefore, a person should fearlessly \nengage in the worship of Bhagvãn.” \n \n57.11 At that point, Mulji Brahm-Chãri came to call Shreeji Mahãrãj for His \nmeals, and they both left the sabhã together. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 57 || 190 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 58 \nThe Flourishing Of A Sampradãy \n \n58.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Shrãvan sud 4 [29th July 1824], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a large, \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on \nthe veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr \nin Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of \nmunis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 568 - \n58.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “How do the sampradãys of the great \nãchãryas flourish for a long period of time?” \n \n58.3 Muktãnand Swãmi answered, “Firstly, by the shãstras of the \nsampradãy; secondly, by following the dharma of a person’s varna \nand ãshram as prescribed in the shãstras; and thirdly, by total belief \nin a person’s ishta-dev.  A sampradãy flourishes by these three \nfactors.” \n \n58.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then asked the same question to Brahmãnand Swãmi \nand Nityãnand Swãmi.  They also gave the same reply. \n \n58.5 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Here, allow me to answer the question.  \nA sampradãy flourishes by knowing the following:  The purpose for \nwhich the ishta-dev of the sampradãy took birth on earth; and after \ntaking birth, the various charitras He performed, as well as the ways \nin which He behaved.  Through His behaviour, dharma as well as the \ngreatness of that ishta-dev is naturally revealed.  In this way, a \nsampradãy is advanced by the shãstras which narrate the charitras of \nits ishta-dev from His birth up until His passing away.  Regardless of \nwhether those shãstras are in Sanskrit or in a different language, only \nthose shãstras will advance the sampradãy, not others. \n \n58.6 “For example, those who worship Rãm Bhagvãn will be inspired only \nby the Vãlmiki Rãmãyan ; and those who worship Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn will be inspired only by the tenth and eleventh skandhs of \nthe Shreemad Bhãgvat.  The Veds will not inspire those who worship \nRãm Bhagvãn or Shree Krishna Bhagvãn.  Ultimately, only the shãstras \nof a person’s own sampradãy will advance the sampradãy.” \n \n58.7 Having said this, “Shreeji Mahãrãj then commanded Muktãnand \nSwãmi:  “You too should continuously preach and write shãstras \nrelated to your sampradãy and your ishta-dev for the rest of your life.  \nThis is my ãgnã to you for as long as you live.” \nGADHADÃ II \n- 569 - \n58.8 With great respect for these words of Shreeji Mahãrãj, Muktãnand \nSwãmi promised to devoutly abide by them.  Then, folding his hands, \nhe bowed before Shreeji Mahãrãj. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 58 || 191 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 59 \nBhagvãn And Sant Are Kalyãn-Kãri \n \n59.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Shrãvan sud 12 [6th August 1824], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on \nthe veranda outside the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n59.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “In the four Veds, the Purãns, and the \nhistorical shãstras, there is one central principle, and that is that only \nBhagvãn and His sant can grant kalyãn.  In fact, Bhagvãn’s sant is \ngreater that even Shiv, Brahmã, and the other devs.  So, when a \nperson attains Bhagvãn or His sant, apart from this, there is no other \nkalyãn for that jeev; this itself is ultimate kalyãn. \n \n59.3 “Furthermore, only those who have accumulated a great number of \nrewards from performing good deeds receive the opportunity to \nserve Bhagvãn’s sant, but those who have few merits do not.  So, a \nperson should develop love for Bhagvãn’s sant just as he has love for \nhis wife, son, parents, or brother.  Then, due to this love, the jeev \nbecomes absolutely fulfilled. \n \n59.4 “Moreover, even if a person’s wife, son, or other family members are \nunworthy; and even if they are dishonest and evil, in no way would \nhe perceive avgun in them.  Conversely, even if the bhakta of Bhagvãn \nGADHADÃ II \n- 570 - \npossesses every noble quality, if he were to utter even a few harsh \nwords, then a person would hold a grudge against him for as long as \nhe lives.  If a person has such an attitude, then in no way can he be \nsaid to have as much love for the bhaktas of Bhagvãn as he does for \nhis relatives.  As a result, he would not attain kalyãn. \n \n59.5 “Furthermore, the greatness of the sant is as much as I mentioned \nearlier.  Yet, even after attaining Bhagvãn and His sant, some people \nstill have the doubt, ‘Will I attain kalyãn or not?’  What can be the \nreason for this?  Well, in his past lives, that person had not attained \nBhagvãn or His sant, and nor had he served them.  Therefore, this is a \nnew experience for him, which will show rewards in his subsequent \nlives.  On the other hand, if a person had attained Bhagvãn and His \nsant and had served them in his past lives, then in this life, his love \nfor the bhaktas of Bhagvãn would never diminish; nor would he \nwaver in his nishchay.  Even if his disturbing thoughts related to kãm, \nkrodh, or lobh persisted, his nishchay in Bhagvãn would not dissolve.  \nThen, what can be said about his nishchay not faltering due to some \nother person’s influence?  In fact, even if his own mind were to try to \nsway him from his nishchay, he would still not be swayed.  Such a \nperson’s determination can be said to be like that of Nãth Bhakta, \nVishnudãs, Himrãj Shah and Bhãlchandra Sheth; and Kashidãs and \nDãmodar also had this determination.  When a person possesses such \ndetermination, it should be known that this person has been a bhakta \nof Bhagvãn in a past life.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 59 || 192 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 60 \nOvercoming Difficulties When Performing The Bhakti Of \nBhagvãn \n \n60.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Shrãvan vad 4 [13th August 1824], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in \nGADHADÃ II \n- 571 - \nthe eastern veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes and had tied a \nwhite pãgh around His head.  He had also covered Himself with a \nthin, white cloth.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n60.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj requested, “Please begin a question-answer \ndiscussion.” \n \n60.3 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, life is full of difficulties.  \nAmidst all these difficulties, what understanding should a bhakta of \nBhagvãn develop in order to remain happy at heart?” \n \n60.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj began, “To answer that, I shall tell you about my own \nexperience.”  He then explained, “By keeping the following three \nforms of awareness, I am not obstructed by any disturbances:  \nconstant awareness of the ãtmã, which is distinct from the body; the \nawareness of the perishable nature of all worldly objects; and the \nawareness of Bhagvãn’s greatness.  By keeping these three forms of \nawareness, no difficulties obstruct me in any way. \n \n60.5 “However, if a person does encounter some difficulties, then due to \nthe nature of the chitt, it may appear that there is some disturbance.  \nHowever, the effect of that disturbance does not penetrate into the \nchaitanya.  This can be realised by the fact that a person never \nexperiences disturbances that are occurring externally when he is \ndreaming.  On the other hand, if a disturbance has penetrated into \nthe chaitanya, it is experienced in all three mental states (jãgrat, \nsvapna, and sushupti).  Therefore, because I do not experience any \ndisturbances in my dreams, it can be assumed that no disturbances \nhave affected my chaitanya in any way. \n \n60.6 “Having said this, if a bhakta of Bhagvãn encounters some sort of \ndistressing hardship, it is not as if I do not realise it;  I very much do \nGADHADÃ II \n- 572 - \nfeel it in my heart.  Only a vimukh like Raghunãth-Dãs would not feel \nit.  When Rãmãnand Swãmi left his body, all the satsangis began to \ncry, but Raghunãth-Dãs was not at all upset.  Instead, he wandered \naround, laughing and talking to others.  Therefore, only an outcast or \na vimukh would not feel hurt when a bhakta of Bhagvãn encounters \nsome sort of misery; but a bhakta of Bhagvãn would definitely \nbecome distressed by the suffering of other bhaktas.” \n \n60.7 Continuing, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The shãstras state that if a bhakta \nof Bhagvãn is being killed or harassed by someone, then a person \nwho stands in defence of that bhakta of Bhagvãn – and in doing so \ndies or becomes wounded himself – is totally freed from the five \ngreat sins.  Such is the glory of defending a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  \nHowever, if a person is hurt by the words of the bhaktas of Bhagvãn – \nas if he has been shot in the heart by some arrows – and if a grudge \ndevelops from that hatred to such an extent that it is not resolved as \nlong as he lives, then such a person is like an outcast.  Even if such a \nperson possesses qualities such as dharma and tyãg, or performs tap, \nit is all worthless.  In fact, even if he performs a million other \nactivities, his jeev will not attain kalyãn. \n \n60.8 “In society, if a woman has equal love for her husband as she does for \nanother man, then she is looked upon as being immoral – like a \nprostitute.  Similarly, if a person in this world believes, ‘As far as I am \nconcerned, all sãdhus are equal.  Who is good and who is bad?’, then \neven if he is considered to be a satsangi, he should be known to be a \nvimukh.  In addition, in case a person feels, ‘If I say something \ninappropriate, my own friends will criticise me,’ he listens as someone \nspeaks unkindly of a bhakta of Bhagvãn in order to preserve his \nrespect.  He should also be known to be a vimukh, even though he \nmay be considered to be a satsangi. \n \n60.9 “Therefore, a person should be absolutely loyal to a bhakta of \nBhagvãn – just as he is loyal to his relatives and his mother and \nfather.  If ever some sort of difficulty does happen to arise with a \nGADHADÃ II \n- 573 - \nbhakta of Bhagvãn, only a person who does not develop a grudge, but \nsettles the difference and reunites with that bhakta – like a line \ndrawn in water – can be called a true bhakta of Bhagvãn.” \n \n60.10 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj finally added, “I am very \ncompassionate – like Dattãtrey, Jadbharat, Nãrad, and Shukji.  In fact, \nonce while I was travelling in the east, I came across a group of tyãgis.  \nThey ordered me:  ‘Go and pick some green spinach’.  I replied, ‘I will \nnot pick it, because it too contains a jeev’.  Hearing this, one of them \ndrew a sword and threatened me.  Nevertheless, I did not pick the \nspinach.  This is the extent of my compassionate nature.  However, if \na person looks angrily at a bhakta of Bhagvãn, then even if that \nperson is a relative of mine, I feel like tearing his eyes out; and if he \nshould hurt a bhakta of Bhagvãn with his hands, I feel like cutting his \nhands off.  Such is the hatred I experience; and in those cases, I do not \nshow any compassion.  Only a person who has such loyalty for a \nbhakta of Bhagvãn can be called a complete bhakta of Bhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 60 || 193 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 61 \nNiyams, Nishchay In Bhagvãn, And Loyalty \n \n61.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Shrãvan vad 7 [17th August 1825], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in \nthe eastern veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Gadhadã.  He had tied a golden-bordered, white shelu \naround His head and had covered Himself with another white shelu.  \nHe was also wearing a white khes and a garland of mogrã flowers.  A \nsabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \n61.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A person who possesses three \ncharacteristics can be called a firm satsangi.  What are these three \nGADHADÃ II \n- 574 - \ncharacteristics?  The first is to strictly follow the niyams prescribed \nby his ishta-dev – to such an extent that he would never abandon \nthose niyams even at the cost of his life.  The second is to have \nextremely firm nishchay in Bhagvãn, so much so that he would never \ndiverge from it even if others or his own mind was to raise doubts.  \nThe third is to be loyal to those Vaishnav bhaktas who worship their \nishta-dev – just as parents are loyal to their children, a son is loyal to \nhis father, and a wife is loyal to her husband.  A person who \npossesses these three characteristics completely can be called a firm \nsatsangi.” \n \n61.3 Then continuing, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “When someone comes and \nsits at the front of a sabhã of bhaktas, others think, ‘This person must \nbe a great satsangi’.  However, the test of a great satsangi is as \nfollows:  If he is a grahastha, he would surrender everything he has \nfor Bhagvãn and His bhaktas; and if required to do so, he would even \ngive his life for satsang; and the moment his ishta-dev gives an ãgnã \nfor him to become a paramhans, he would immediately become a \nparamhans.  If a bhakta of Bhagvãn possesses these characteristics, \nthen whether he sits at the front of a sabhã of bhaktas, or at the back, \nhe should be considered to be great amongst all bhaktas.  Moreover, a \ntyãgi who remains unaffected and continues to firmly follow all of his \nniyams, despite encountering wealth and women in his travels to \nother regions, is considered to be great amongst all tyãgis. \n \n61.4 “If a person with rajo-gun, who is considered to be reputable in \nsociety, comes to a sabhã, then he should be respected accordingly \nand given a seat at the very front of the sabhã.  Such etiquette should \nbe observed by those possessing gnãn, as well as by tyãgis.  If they do \nnot, then the consequences can be harmful.  Consider the example of \nwhen Parikshit Rãjã went to the rushi’s ãshram.  The rushi happened \nto be in samãdhi and so the king was not honoured.  As a result, the \nking became angry and threw a dead snake around the rushi’s neck.  \nThen, the rushi’s son cursed the king, leading to the king’s death \nseven days later. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 575 - \n61.5 “There is also the example of when Daksh prajãpati visited Brahma’s \nsabhã.  There, Shivji neither stood up for Daksh, nor welcomed him \nverbally; therefore upsetting Daksh.  He then cancelled Shivji’s share \nin the yagna he performed.  Then, Nandishvar and Bhrugu Rushi \ncursed each other; because of that sin, Sati burnt to death in Daksh’s \nsacrifice.  This prompted Virbhadra to cut off Daksh’s head and offer \nit in the fire, which resulted in Daksh receiving the head of a goat. \n \n61.6 “Therefore, all of you grahasthas and tyãgis should abide by the \nfollowing:  Those who are considered to be respectable in society and \nworldly affairs should in no way be insulted in a sabhã.  If they are \ndishonoured, it will definitely lead to problems and create \nobstructions in worship.  For this reason, all satsangi grahasthas and \ntyãgis should firmly abide by this principle of mine.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 61 || 194 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 62 \nÃtmã-Nishthã, Pati-Vratã, And Sevã \n \n62.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Mãgshar sud 2 [22nd November 1824], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a white khes and had \ntied a white pãgh around His head.  Also, He had covered Himself \nwith a white chofãl.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n62.2  Shreeji Mahãrãj then summoned His nephews, Ayodhyãprasãdji and \nRaghuvirji, and said to them, “You may ask me questions.” \n \n62.3 Then, Ayodhyãprasãdji first asked, “In life, a man may be engrossed \nin the entanglements of worldly affairs all day long, and during that \ntime, he may well perform some moral as well as immoral karmas.  \nGADHADÃ II \n- 576 - \nMoreover, he may engage in worship for only half an hour or so.  Is \nthis enough to burn all of the sins he has committed during the day, \nor not?  That is my question?” \n \n62.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Even if a person has spent the whole day in \npravrutti, and regardless of whatever type of activities he may have \nbeen involved in, when he engages in the worship of Bhagvãn, if his \nindriyas, antah-karans, and jeev all unite and become engrossed in \nworship, then even if he does so for half an hour, or even for a few \nminutes, all of his sins will be burnt to ashes.  However, if his indriyas, \nantah-karans, and jeev do not unite and engage in worship, then his \nsins cannot be burned by worshipping for such a short while.  Such a \nperson can attain kalyãn only by the grace of Bhagvãn.  This is the \nanswer to your question.” \n \n62.5 Next, Raghuvirji asked a question, “Mahãrãj, what must a person do \nfor the moksh of the jeev?” \n \n62.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “If a person seeks kalyãn, he should place \nhis body, wealth, home, family, and relations in the sevã of Bhagvãn.  \nFurthermore, he should avoid any object that may not be of use in the \nsevã of Bhagvãn.  A person who lives a life centred around Bhagvãn \njoins the ranks of Nãrad and the Sanakãdik in the dhãm of Bhagvãn \nand attains ultimate moksh after he dies, even if he is a grahastha.  \nThis is the answer to your question.” \n \n62.7 Having answered their questions, Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Since \nthe day I began thinking about it, I have noticed that there are three \nstrengths which lead to kalyãn and which lead to extreme bliss.  Of \nthese, the first is the strength of intense ãtmã-nishthã, which is to \nbelieve a person’s true self to be the ãtmã and engage in worship of \nBhagvãn, like Shukji.  The second is like the strength of pati-vratã, \nwhich is to worship Bhagvãn as if He is his husband, just as the gopis \ndid.  The third is the strength of sevã, which is to worship Bhagvãn as \nGADHADÃ II \n- 577 - \nHis dãs, just like Hanumãnji and Uddhavji.  Without these three \nstrengths, there is no way in which the jeev can attain kalyãn.  In fact, \nI, myself have firmly developed all three of these strengths.  Even if a \nperson possesses one of these strengths firmly, he becomes \nabsolutely fulfilled. \n \n62.8 “I shall now describe the characteristics of these three strengths \nindividually.  Firstly, the following are the characteristics of a person \nwho has realised the ãtmã.  On one side there is the ãtmã and on the \nother side is the crowd of Mãyã – the body, the indriyas, the antah-\nkarans, the three gun, and the panch-vishays.  The thought that rests \nbetween the two is full of gnãn.  This thought remains steady, just as \nthe tip of a flame remains steady in the absence of wind.  It is this \nthought which prevents the body, indriyas, and antah-karans from \nbecoming one with the ãtmã.  In fact, even the thought itself does not \nbecome one with the ãtmã. \n \n62.9 “When the jeev attains this thought, its vruttis, which once reached all \nthe way to Kãshi, recede to reach only as far as Vadtãl.  When that \nthought is strengthened, the vruttis then recede from Vadtãl to reach \nonly as far as Gadhadã.  Then, from reaching as far as Gadhadã, they \nrecede and come into the vicinity of the body.  From the body, the \nvruttis recede further and rest in the organs of the indriyas.  From the \norgans of the indriyas, the vruttis of the indriyas turn inward towards \nthe antah-karans.  Finally, the vruttis of the indriyas and antah-karans \nbecome absorbed in the ãtmã.  It is then that the jeev’s kãran body, \nwhich is full of worldly desires, is said to be destroyed. \n \n62.10 “Furthermore, when this thought meets with the ãtmã, divine light is \ngenerated in the heart of the thinker, and he understands himself as \nbeing brahm-rup.  In addition, he also has the realisation of Parbrahm \nNãrãyan, who resides within that brahm.  A person who has this \nrealisation feels, ‘I am the ãtmã, and Paramãtmã eternally resides \nwithin me’.  Such a sustained state is the highest level of ãtmã-\nnishthã. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 578 - \n \n62.11 “Secondly, the strength of a person with pati-vratã should be like that \nof the gopis of Vraj.  For example, from the day the gopis touched the \nholy feet of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, all the pleasures of this world \nbecame like poison to them.  In this way, if a pati-vratã wife sees a \nman who is as handsome as Indra, or who is like a dev or some king, \nthen she would withdraw her eyes, just as when a person sees a \nrotting dog or some faeces and becomes extremely disgusted and \nlooks away.  This is the highest level of pati-vratã.  Therefore, if a \nperson attaches his vruttis to Bhagvãn just as a pati-vratã wife does \nwith her husband, his mind would never become pleased upon \nseeing anyone else. \n \n62.12 “Thirdly, a person who has a strength of offering bhakti with sevã \nwould like the darshan only of his ishta-dev; he would like to hear \ntalks only about Him; he would like His ishtadev’s nature; and he \nwould also prefer to stay only with Him.  However, even though he \nhas such love, for the sake of serving his ishta-dev and earning His \npleasure, he wishes day and night, ‘If my ishta-dev were to command \nme, I would follow that command most happily’.  If his ishta-dev was to \ngive a command that would force him to stay far away, he would stay \nthere happily, but in no way would he be disheartened.  In fact, he \nfinds supreme bliss in following the command itself.  This is the \nhighest level of sevã.  Today, Gopãlãnand Swãmi and also Muktãnand \nSwãmi have the strength of offering bhakti with sevã. \n \n62.13 “Among the bhaktas of Bhagvãn who possess one of these three \nstrengths, there are three levels – uttam, madhyam, and kanishth.  \nThose who are not found in any one of these categories can only be \ncalled wretched.  Therefore, it is only proper to die after a person has \nthoroughly developed one of the three strengths; it is not appropriate \nto die if a person has not completely developed any single one of the \nthree.  Instead, it would be better if a person lives five days longer to \ndispel his misunderstandings and strengthen at least one of these \nthree inclinations, and then die.” \nGADHADÃ II \n- 579 - \n62.14 Continuing, Shreeji Mahãrãj added, “The nature of the jeev is such \nthat when a person is a grahastha, he would prefer to abandon \nworldly life; but once he has abandoned the world, he has desires for \nthe pleasures of worldly life once again.  This is the rebellious nature \nof the jeev.  Therefore, a person who is a firm bhakta of Bhagvãn \nshould worship Bhagvãn after discarding such a rebellious nature as \nwell as all of his personal likes and dislikes.  Moreover, it is only \nappropriate to die after eradicating all desires other than those of \nBhagvãn. \n \n62.15 “However, if a person does not have intense love for Bhagvãn, he \nshould strengthen only ãtmã-nishthã by thought.  This is because a \nbhakta of Bhagvãn should either possess firm ãtmã-nishthã or \nextremely deep love for Bhagvãn.  If a person is not firm in either one \nof these two strengths, he should strictly abide by the niyams of this \nsatsang.  Only then will he be able to remain a satsangi; otherwise he \nwill fall from satsang. \n \n62.16 “When a bhakta of Bhagvãn experiences difficulties of any kind, it \nshould be known that the source of those miseries is not Kãl, karma, \nor Mãyã.  In actual fact, it is Bhagvãn Himself who inspires difficulties \nto fall upon His bhaktas in order to test their patience.  Then, just as a \nman hides behind a curtain and watches, Bhagvãn hides in the heart \nof His bhakta and from there He observes the bhakta’s patience.  Also \nwho are Kãl, karma, and Mãyã that they could harm a bhakta of \nBhagvãn?  So, realising it to be Bhagvãn’s wish, a bhakta of Bhagvãn \nshould remain cheerful.” \n \n62.17 Upon hearing this, Muktãnand Swãmi asked a question:  “Mahãrãj, \nthe talk in which you have just described the three strengths is very \nsubtle and difficult to put into practice.  Only a few can understand it \nand only a few can actually live by it; not everyone can do so.  \nHowever, there are hundreds of thousands of people in satsang, and \nit would be difficult for all of them to understand this principle.  So, \nhow can they progress?” \nGADHADÃ II \n- 580 - \n62.18 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “If a person behaves as a dãs of the dãs of \na bhakta who possesses one of these three strengths, and if he also \nfollows his ãgnã, then despite not understanding anything else, he \nwould certainly become a pãrshad of Bhagvãn after this very life, and \nwould therefore become fulfilled. \n \n62.19 “In this world, the glory of Bhagvãn and His bhaktas is indeed very \ngreat.  After all, no matter how sinful or insignificant a person may \nbe, if he seeks the refuge of Bhagvãn and His bhaktas, that person will \nbecome absolutely fulfilled.  Such is the greatness of Bhagvãn and His \nbhaktas.  Therefore, a person who has received the opportunity to \nserve the bhaktas of Bhagvãn’s should remain fearless.” \n \n62.20 Finally, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “I have delivered this talk about the \nthree strengths mainly for the sake of Muktãnand Swãmi because I \nhave a great deal of love for him.  So, bearing in mind that Muktãnand \nSwãmi is suffering from an illness, I spoke today to be sure that no \nform of deficiency remains in his understanding.” \n \n62.21 In reply, Muktãnand Swãmi said, “Mahãrãj, I also felt that you \ndelivered this talk for me.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 62 || 195 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 63 \nGaining Strength After Performing Sevã \n \n63.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Mãgshar vad 2 [8th December 1824], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in His place of \nresidence in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  Bhajanãnand Swãmi was reading the \nShreemad Bhãgvat before Shreeji Mahãrãj, and a sabhã of paramhans, \nas well as haribhaktas from various places, had also gathered before \nHim. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 581 - \n63.2 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “The thought which rests between \nthe drashtã and the drashya keeps the drashtã and drashya \nseparated.  In this, what should be understood as the consciousness \nof the jeev and what should be understood as the consciousness of \nthe antah-karans?” \n \n63.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “It seems to me that if a person’s jeev has \nbecome extremely powerful, then the vruttis of his antah-karans are \nin the vruttis of his jeev.  These vruttis seem to be divided into four \ncategories, according to the four respective functions of the antah-\nkarans.  Therefore, the awareness in the indriyas and antah-karans is \nthat of the jeev itself.  Therefore, the jeev allows the indriyas and \nantah-karans to apply themselves wherever it is appropriate to do so \nand restricts them from doing as they please where it is \ninappropriate to do so.  In fact, if a person’s jeev has become very \npowerful, he would not even have impure dreams.  On the other \nhand, if a person’s jeev is lacking in strength, then he should follow \nthe principle of Sãnkhya and behave only as the ãtmã (drashtã); but, \na person should not associate with his indriyas and antah-karans.  By \nbehaving as the ãtmã in this way, his jeev gains great strength. \n \n63.4 “However, there is an even greater method than this to gain strength.  \nIf a person has love for Bhagvãn and His sant, possesses intense \nshraddhã in serving them, and also engages in the nine types of \nbhakti, then his jeev will instantly gain strength.  Therefore, for \nmaking the jeev stronger, there is no method comparable to that of \nserving Bhagvãn and His bhaktas. \n \n63.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “I shall now tell you a personal principle of \nmine.  When I became ill in the year of Samvat 1869, I saw Kailãs and \nVaikunth, and I also saw myself riding on Nandishvar and riding on \nGarud.  However, I did not find any pleasure in those powers.  Then, I \nbegan to behave only as the ãtmã, at which point all disturbances \ndecreased.  However, then I thought, ‘Much better than behaving as \nGADHADÃ II \n- 582 - \nthe ãtmã is to stay within the company of Bhagvãn and His bhaktas’.  I \nthen become afraid, ‘What if by behaving as the ãtmã, I cannot return \nto this body again?’  Therefore, to stay within the company of \nBhagvãn and His bhaktas and to be able to serve them in whichever \nway possible, is indeed the very best spiritual activity.” \n \n63.6 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “Countless types of mental and \nphysical suffering arise during the final moments of a person’s life.  \nBut, when a person has the darshan of Bhagvãn and His sant, all those \nmiseries are expelled.  This is the greatness of Bhagvãn and His \nbhaktas.  In actual fact, the bhaktas of Bhagvãn are indeed nothing \nbut a murti of brahm.  That is why a person should never perceive \nhuman traits in them. \n \n63.7 “In addition, with the bhaktas of Bhagvãn a person should behave in \nthe same way as family members do amongst themselves.  For \nexample, even if a person lectures his own family members out of \nlove, or if they happen to lecture him, grudges still do not develop in \ntheir hearts.  With bhaktas of Bhagvãn, a person should behave in the \nsame way.  On the other hand, if a person does develop a grudge with \nBhagvãn or His bhaktas, I do not even like to look at him.  In fact, my \nanger with such a person never subsides.  Moreover, those in this \nworld who commit the five great sins can still be redeemed someday, \nwhereas a person who spites bhaktas of Bhagvãn can never be \nredeemed. \n \n63.8 “Therefore, there is no reward greater than that of serving bhaktas of \nBhagvãn, and there is no sin greater than that of spiting bhaktas of \nBhagvãn.  Therefore, if a person wishes to make his jeev powerful, \nthen he should sincerely serve Bhagvãn and His bhaktas by thought, \nword, and deed.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 63 || 196 || \n \nGADHADÃ II \n- 583 - \nGadhadã II – 64 \nPurushottam Bhagvãn Is The Cause Of All Avatãrs \n \n64.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Posh sud 7 [27th December 1824], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a large, \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on \nthe veranda outside the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n64.2 Then, Svayamprakãshãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, are all avatãrs \nof Bhagvãn equal, or are there distinctions among them?” \n \n64.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “After listening to and analytically \nthinking about all the shãstras written by Vyãsji, the conclusion I have \nreached regarding the avatãrs of Bhagvãn, such as Matsya, Kurma, \nVarãh, and Nrusinh, is that Shree Krishna Bhagvãn is the source of \nthem all.  That is to say, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn is not an avatãr like \nthe other avatãrs, but is Himself the source of all avatãrs.  That very \nShree Krishna Bhagvãn is our ishta-dev.  His divya charitras are \nnarrated in the tenth skandh of the Shreemad Bhãgvat Purãn.  I have \nalso considered it as a great authority in our Uddhav Sampradãy. \n \n64.4 “As all other avatãrs are also of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, we should \nrespect those avatãrs and all shãstras which describe those avatãrs.  \nNevertheless, we should primarily respect only Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn and the shãstras which describe Him.” \n \n64.5 Then, Purushottam Bhatt asked a question, “Bhagvãn created this \nworld for the kalyãn of the jeevs.  But, would it not have been possible \nfor Bhagvãn, without creating this world, to grant kalyãn to the jeevs \nwhile they were dormant in the womb of Mãyã?  Instead, why does \nHe take the trouble of creating this whole world?  That is the \nquestion.” \nGADHADÃ II \n- 584 - \n64.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Bhagvãn Shree Krishna Purushottam is the \nsupreme ruler and is eternal.  He is forever present on His sinhãsan in \nHis Akshardhãm.  Countless millions of brahmãnds reside within the \nrefuge of that Akshardhãm.  For example, a king who rules over the \nwhole world owns innumerable villages; and of those, if one or two \nwere to become deserted, or if one or two became populated, he \nwould not even take notice.  Similarly, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn is the \nlord of countless millions of brahmãnds.  However, the brahmãnds \nare not destroyed all at once.  Therefore, if one or two brahmãnds are \ndestroyed, Bhagvãn would not even take note of it. \n \n64.7 “In addition, the birth of that Shree Krishna Bhagvãn from Devki is \nonly for the sake of narration, because in actual fact, He is forever \nbeyond birth. \n \n64.8 “Furthermore, the Akshardhãm of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn is beyond \nPrakruti and Purush by its vyatirek nature, and it pervades \neverywhere by its anvay nature – just as ãkãsh is present everywhere \nby its anvay nature, and is beyond the four bhuts by its vyatirek \nnature.  This is Shree Krishna Bhagvãn’s Akshardhãm. \n \n64.9 “Moreover, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn forever dwells within that dhãm.  \nHowever, despite being present in Akshardhãm, He also grants \ndarshan to whomever, wherever, and in whichever way it is \nnecessary.  He speaks to whomever it is necessary to speak to, and \neven touches whomever it is necessary to touch.  Just as a person \nwho has attained siddh-dashã can see for thousands of miles while \nremaining in one place, and hear talks from thousands of miles away, \nsimilarly, despite being in His Akshardhãm, Bhagvãn also reveals \nHimself in the countless millions of brahmãnds wherever there is a \nneed to be revealed.  Nevertheless, He Himself is still always present \nin His Akshardhãm.  The fact that He remains in one place and yet \nreveals himself in countless places is a demonstration of his \nextraordinary powers – just as during the rãs-leelã, when He \nGADHADÃ II \n- 585 - \nassumed as many svarups as there were gopis.  This use of Bhagvãn’s \nextraordinary powers to remain in one place and at the same time to \nappear in countless places is itself His pervasive svarup.  However, \nunlike ãkãsh, he does not pervade without possessing a svarup. \n \n64.10 “Moreover, by the extraordinary powers of Bhagvãn, the five \nhundred million yojan surface of the pruthvi becomes the size of a \nsub-atomic particle at the time of destruction.  Then, at the time of \ncreation, from being sub-atomic in size, the pruthvi again becomes \nfive hundred million yojans large.  Also, thunder, lightning, and dense \nclouds of rain appear in the monsoon season.  These and all other \nsuch wonders are all due to the extraordinary powers of Bhagvãn. \n \n64.11 “That Shree Krishna Bhagvãn is worthy to be worshipped by a \nmumukshu in every way.  While the other avatãrs possessed the \ngreatness of maybe one or two powers, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn \npossesses all powers.  After all, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn is not only \nrasik, He is also a tyãgi; He possesses gnãn and is also the sovereign \nruler; He is a coward as well as brave; He is extremely compassionate \nand is a master of all extraordinary powers; and He is very strong as \nwell as very deceptive.  In this respect, only Shree Krishna Bhagvãn \npossesses all powers. \n \n64.12 “It is in Shree Krishna Bhagvãn’s Akshardhãm that the countless \nmillions of brahmãnds are supported forever.  Of those, when the \nhundred year lifespan (the lifespan of Brahmã) of a particular \nbrahmãnd ends, that brahmãnd is destroyed.  From this, it is clear \nthat not all brahmãnds are destroyed as the same time.  So, if other \nbrahmãnds are still present at the time of destruction, why should \nBhagvãn grant kalyãn to the jeevs at that time?  This is the answer to \nthe question.” \n \n64.13 In this way, Shreeji Mahãrãj indirectly revealed Himself as \nPurushottam.  Upon hearing this, all the bhaktas realised that the \nGADHADÃ II \n- 586 - \nsame Shree Krishna Purushottam is in actual fact Shreeji Mahãrãj, the \nson of Dharma and Bhakti. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 64 || 197 || \n \n \nGadhadã II – 65 \nThe Darshan Of The Murti Of Bhagvãn \nThe Over-Wise \n \n65.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Posh sud 11 [1st January 1825], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead near \nthe mandir of Shree Vãsudev-Nãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, \nas well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n65.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please listen, as I wish to speak about \nBhagvãn.” \n \n65.3 The sãdhus, who were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a \npakhvãj, stopped singing.  They then folded their hands and settled \ndown to listen. \n \n65.4 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj began, “When Bhagvãn takes birth on earth for \nthe kalyãn of the jeevs as an avatãr, such as Rãm and Krishna, He is \nnot infatuated by anything in this world, which is the result of Mãyã.  \nIn fact, due to His alokik majesty, He behaves absolutely fearlessly.  \nHowever, for the sake of accepting the bhakti of His bhaktas, He also \nthoroughly indulges in the panch-vishays.  Seeing this, those people in \nthe world who are over-wise, perceive faults in Bhagvãn.  They think, \n‘He may be called Bhagvãn, but He has more attachment to this world \nthan we do’.  Thinking this, they consider Bhagvãn to be human, just \nlike themselves, but they do not realise His alokik greatness.  This in \nitself is Bhagvãn’s Mãyã. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 587 - \n65.5 “In fact, even a sãdhu who has realised the ãtmã and has become \nbrahm-rup is not infatuated upon seeing any object of this world.  So, \nwhat is surprising about Shree Krishna Bhagvãn – who is Parbrahm, \nand who is greater than Brahm – being able to remain uninfluenced \nby Mãyã and the result of Mãyã?  He certainly can.” \n \n65.6 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A sãdhu who has attained \nãtmã-nishthã also possesses intense vairãgya.  Due to both of these \nqualities, he will not become attached to anything in any way.  \nHowever, if he does not possess bhakti towards Bhagvãn, it is as good \nas preparing many different types of food dishes but not adding salt; \nall would be tasteless.  In the same way, without the bhakti of \nBhagvãn, ãtmã-nishthã and vairãgya alone are simply useless; a \nperson can never attain kalyãn through them. \n \n65.7 “Realising this, Shukji studied the Shreemad Bhãgvat and offered \ngreat bhakti to Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, despite having already \nbecome brahm-svarup.  Therefore, it is a great deficiency of a person \nwho has ãtmã-nishthã to not have bhakti towards Bhagvãn. \n \n65.8 “In the same way, if a person has bhakti towards Bhagvãn, but does \nnot have ãtmã-nishthã and vairãgya, then just as a person has love \ntowards Bhagvãn, he will also develop love towards other things.  \nTherefore, this is a major deficiency for those following the path of \nbhakti. \n \n65.9 “Now, a perfect bhakta of Bhagvãn has thoroughly realised Bhagvãn’s \ngreatness; so, everything except Bhagvãn seems worthless to him.  \nThat is why he is not infatuated by anything.  Therefore, when a \nperson possesses all three qualities of ãtmã-nishthã, vairãgya, and \nbhakti towards Bhagvãn, he can be said to have no deficiencies \nwhatsoever.  Such a person is called a bhakta with gnãn, an ekãntik \nbhakta, and a loyal bhakta of Bhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 65 || 198 || \nGADHADÃ II \n- 588 - \nGadhadã II – 66 \nA Person Cannot Recognise His Own Avgun \nA Red-Hot Iron Ball \n \n66.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Posh vad 1 [5th January 1825], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a large, \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on \nthe veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr \nin Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  Garlands of \nyellow flowers and red guldãvadi flowers were hanging around His \nneck, and a tassel of yellow flowers decorated His pãgh.  A sabhã of \nmunis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him in a sabhã.  Some of the sãdhus were singing a vishnupad \nto the accompaniment of a sarodã and dukad. \n \n66.2 After the kirtans had finished, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Today, I wish to \nask all the senior sãdhus some questions.”  Having said this, He \ndirected His first question to Ãnandãnand Swãmi.  He said, “Suppose \nthere is a person who recognises his own faults and does not look at \nthe avgun of other bhaktas, despite having little intelligence; instead, \nhe looks only at their gun.  On the other hand, suppose there is \nanother person who is very intelligent, but he does not see his own \navgun.  Moreover, he overlooks the gun of other bhaktas and looks \nonly at their avgun.  Why is it that the person with little intelligence \nfinds avgun in himself, whereas the person with much intelligence \ncannot realise his own avgun?  That is the question.” \n \n66.3 Ãnãnd Swãmi answered to the bet of his ability, but he was unable to \ngive a satisfactory reply. \n \n66.4 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The answer to that is as follows:  It is \nbecause that person has offended some great bhakta of Bhagvãn \neither in this life or in a past life.  As a result of that sin, his intellect \nhas become corrupted.  That is why he perceives avgun in bhaktas \nwithout being able to realise avgun in himself.  This is the only \nanswer to that question.” \nGADHADÃ II \n- 589 - \n66.5 Next, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked Nityãnand Swãmi a question, “Is there \nonly one method to attain Bhagvãn, or are there many?  You may say \nthat Bhagvãn can be attained by four methods – gnãn, vairãgya, \nbhakti, and dharma.  However, if Bhagvãn is attained by these four \nmethods, then the principle that kalyãn can be attained exclusively by \nseeking the refuge Bhagvãn is invalid.” \n \n66.6 Nityãnand Swãmi tried to answer the question in many different \nways, but was unable to do so satisfactorily. \n \n66.7 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Kalyãn is only attained by the refuge of \nBhagvãn.  However, Bhagvãn is very powerful; even the devs live \nunder His ãgnã.  In fact, out of fear of Bhagvãn, even the causes of all \nthe brahmãnds, such as Kãl and Mãyã, faithfully follow His ãgnã.  \nTherefore, a bhakta of Bhagvãn should also strictly follow Bhagvãn’s \nãgnã; that is the very characteristic of a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  For this \nreason, all other spiritual activities should also be performed strictly.  \nTherefore, kalyãn is possible only through Bhagvãn, whereas those \nspiritual activities are for the purpose of pleasing Bhagvãn.  That is \nthe only answer to the question.” \n \n66.8 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked Brahmãnand Swãmi, “Is the jeev that \ndwells within the body, sãkãr, or is it nirãkãr?” \n \n66.9 Brahmãnand Swãmi replied, “It possesses a svarup.” \n \n66.10 Hearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If the jeev did possess a svarup, \nthen that would mean it has hands, feet, and other limbs.  However, a \nshlok in the tenth skandh of the Shreemad Bhãgvat states, ‘Bhagvãn \ncreated the buddhi, indriyas, man, and prãns to enable the jeev to \nattain kalyãn’.  If the jeev itself did possess a svarup, then what would \nbe the need of creating the buddhi, indriyas, man, and prãns for it?  \nTherefore, after seeing such words in the shãstras, a person can only \nconclude that the jeev is sachidãnand. \nGADHADÃ II \n- 590 - \n66.11 “That jeev also possesses the kãran body, which is the embodiment of \neternal ignorance.  Just as a magnetic rock attracts iron and then \nsticks to the iron, similarly, the jeev has a nature of sticking.  \nTherefore, the jeev sticks to the two mãyik bodies – the sthul body \nand the sukshma body.  Then, due to its ignorance, the jeev believes \nthose bodies to be its own.  In reality, the jeev is not at all like those \nbodies.” \n \n66.12 Then, Brahmãnand Swãmi asked, “After the ignorance of the jeev is \nremoved by the bhakti of Bhagvãn, the association between the jeev \nand the three mãyik bodies (sthul, sukshma, and kãran) no longer \nremains.  So, when the jeev attains the dhãm of Bhagvãn, with what \ntype of svarup does it stay there?” \n \n66.13 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “When the jeev’s ignorance is dispelled, its \nassociation with the three mãyik bodies is broken.  Then, the jeev \nremains pure and composed of chaitanya.  Then, by Bhagvãn’s will, \nthe jeev receives a body composed of chaitanya prakruti – which is \ndistinct from the eight types of jad prakruti of Bhagvãn.  Then, with \nthat body, the jeev stays in Bhagvãn’s Akshardhãm.  This is the \nanswer to your question.” \n \n66.14 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked Gopãlãnand Swãmi a question; “It is due \nto the grace of Bhagvãn and His sant that a person can master \nashtãng-yog or see the ãtmã.  Then, why is it that even though \nBhagvãn and His sant are the cause of these, they become secondary; \nand instead, a person’s interest in yog and ãtmã-nishthã increases?” \n \n66.15 Gopãlãnand Swãmi replied, “After practicing ashtãng-yog, when a \nperson actually masters it, he develops a little pride.  As a result, he \nbecomes somewhat less interested in Bhagvãn.” \n \n66.16 To this, Shreeji Mahãrãj commented, “When a yogi attains siddh-\ndashã, he also becomes brahm-rup, and no form of pride is possible in \nbrahm.  Therefore, your answer is not correct.” \nGADHADÃ II \n- 591 - \n66.17 Gopãlãnand Swãmi then said, “Mahãrãj, I cannot understand this.  \nPlease be compassionate and explain it to me.” \n \n66.18 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “It should be understood in the following \nway: When a person wishes to eradicate his faults, he should \neradicate them after seeking advice of a great sant.  For example, if a \nperson has some worldly task to perform, and he wants to \naccomplish that job extremely well, he should seek the advice of \nsome experts.  Similarly, such advice is also necessary for eradicating \nfaults.  For example, even though Shukji had become brahm-svarup, \nhe studied the Shreemad Bhãgvat with great enthusiasm.  In fact, \neven to this very day, he engages in the bhakti of Bhagvãn.  Also, the \neighty-eight thousand rushis, including Shaunak, had become brahm-\nsvarup; but, they too listened to the kathãs related to Bhagvãn from \nSutpurãni.  Therefore, a person should take guidance from such \nwords to strengthen his bhakti. \n \n66.19 “For the faults that a person cannot recognise, he should pray to \nBhagvãn:  ‘Mahãrãj, please be compassionate and destroy whichever \nfaults I may have’ – just as when a man has been accused of \nsomething and has no witnesses to disprove the allegation, he proves \nhis innocence by holding a red-hot iron ball.  Similarly, if a fault \ncannot be realised, he should pray to Bhagvãn for the eradication of \nthat fault, which amounts to holding the iron ball.  A person should \neradicate his faults in this way.  That is the answer to your question.” \n \n66.20 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked Muktãnand Swãmi a question:  “Suppose \na bhakta of Bhagvãn has thoroughly realised Bhagvãn, but Bhagvãn \ndoes not show him any miracles.  Now, if some other performer of \nmagical spells does show him a miracle, then upon seeing this, would \nthe mind of that bhakta sway from Bhagvãn, or not?” \n \n66.21 Muktãnand Swãmi replied, “Mahãrãj, if a person has absolute \nnishchay in Bhagvãn, then he would never have nishchay in anyone \nGADHADÃ II \n- 592 - \nbut Bhagvãn.  On the other hand, if a person does have nishchay in \nsomeone else, then he does not have nishchay in Bhagvãn at all.  Such \na person is merely a false bhakta; he cannot be called a true bhakta of \nBhagvãn.” \n \n66.22 Hearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj agreed, “That is the exact answer to the \nquestion.” \n \n66.23 Finally, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked Shuk Muni, “If a bhakta of Bhagvãn has \nattained the understanding of Bhagvãn and His sant, then how does \nhe benefit while he is alive, and how does he benefit after he dies?” \n \n66.24 Shuk Muni said, “Mahãrãj, that question can be answered only by \nyou.” \n \n66.25 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “While alive, a person who has attained \nBhagvãn and His sant spends his days and nights engrossed in kathãs \nand kirtans related to Bhagvãn.  He also has the direct realisation of \nhis jeevãtmã, which is beyond the three mental states, as being \nbrahm-rup.  With the exception of Bhagvãn, he develops vairãgya for \nall other objects.  Also, he discards adharma and abides by dharma. \n \n66.26 “When that bhakta dies, Bhagvãn makes him just like Himself.  In fact, \nBhagvãn had blessed Brahma:  ‘O Brahmã!  By my grace, may you \nknow me as I am, my glory as it is, and my qualities and actions as they \nare’.  So, just as Bhagvãn has blessed Brahmã, He also grants the same \nblessings to all of His faithful bhaktas.  In addition, just as Bhagvãn is \nfree from Kãl, karma, and Mãyã, in the same way, these bhaktas of \nBhagvãn also becomes free from Kãl, karma, and Mãyã.  Also, he \nforever resides in the sevã of Bhagvãn.  This is how that bhakta \nbenefits after he abandons his body.  That is the answer to the \nquestion.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 66 || 199 || \nGADHADÃ II \n- 593 - \nGadhadã II – 67 \nThe Gangãjaliyo Well \nBecoming Like Bhagvãn \n \n67.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Mahã vad 3 [6th February 1825], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a large, \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on \nthe platform near the Gangãjaliyo well adjacent to His residence in \nDãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him in a sabhã.  Some of the sãdhus were singing \na vishnupad to the accompaniment of a sarodã and dukad. \n  \n67.2 After thinking about the kirtans, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “I wish to ask \nall the sãdhus the following question:  A bhakta of Bhagvãn leaves his \nbody, becomes brahm-rup, and attains the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  Then, \nwhat is the difference between that bhakta and Bhagvãn, whereby \nthe master-servant relationship between them still remains?  After \nall, that bhakta of Bhagvãn then becomes independent, just like \nBhagvãn.  He also becomes free from the restraints of Kãl, karma, and \nMãyã – just like Bhagvãn.  Therefore, what difference remains so that \nthe master-servant relationship is maintained?  This is my question.” \n \n67.3 The paramhans answered according to their understanding, but they \ncould not give a precise answer to Shreeji Mahãrãj’s question.  So, all \nthe sãdhus said, “Mahãrãj, your question will only be answered when \nyou yourself answer it.” \n \n67.4 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The answer is as follows:  In \nwhatever way a bhakta of Bhagvãn has understood Bhagvãn –\n‘Bhagvãn possesses this many powers; He possesses this much charm; \nHe is the embodiment of bliss’ – that is the extent to which he has \nunderstood the greatness of Bhagvãn.  Then, when that bhakta leaves \nhis body and goes to the dhãm of Bhagvãn, he attains charm and \nGADHADÃ II \n- 594 - \npowers based on the extent to which he has realised the majesty of \nBhagvãn.  Despite this, that bhakta still feels Bhagvãn’s majesty (His \npowers and charm) to be much greater.  He then realises, ‘Bhagvãn \nhas granted me just as many divya powers and as much charm as I had \nrealised in Him.  Yet, Bhagvãn’s divya powers and charm appear to be \ntotally limitless.  Like me, countless others have also attained qualities \nsimilar to that of Bhagvãn, but no one is capable of becoming like \nBhagvãn’. \n \n67.5 “This is because not even Shesh, Shãrada, Brahmã, the other devs, or \nthe four Veds can understand the vastness of Bhagvãn’s greatness, \nHis qualities, His actions, His birth, His power, His charm, His blissful \nnature, or His countless other kalyãn-kãri.  In fact, Bhagvãn Himself \ncannot understand the limits of His own greatness.  Therefore, \nBhagvãn, with all of His powers, is beyond all limits. \n \n67.6 “By worshipping that Bhagvãn, countless millions of Vaishnavs have \nbecome like Bhagvãn.  However, Bhagvãn’s majesty has not \ndiminished even slightly.  For example, even if there were an ocean \nfilled with sweet water from which all humans, animals, and birds \ncould drink as much as they wished, and from which vessels could be \nfilled, the water would still not decrease because of the vastness of \nthe ocean.  Similarly, Bhagvãn’s greatness is infinite; there is no way \nin which it can either increase or decrease.  For this reason, those \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn who become brahm-svarup, still behave as \nBhagvãn’s servants and engage in His worship.  In this way, bhaktas \nof Bhagvãn attain qualities similar to those of Bhagvãn; but, the \nmaster-servant relationship between them is maintained.  That is the \nanswer to the question.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã II || 67 || 200 || \n \n \n|| End of Shree Gadhadã Madhya Prakaran ||\nVADTÃL \n- 595 - \n|| SHREE SWÃMINÃRAYAN VIJAYTETRÃM || \n \nVACHANÃMRUT \nShree Vadtãl Prakaran \n \nVadtãl – 1 \nNirvikalp Samãdhi \n \n1.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Kãrtik sud 11 [21st November 1825], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a cushion with a \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a sinhãsan in the mango \ngrove along the banks of Lake Gomti on the north side of the mandir \nof Shree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in Vadtãl.  He was wearing a white survãl \nand a white angarkhu.  He had also tied a blue reto around His waist.  \nAn orange reto with edges decorated with golden threads was tied \naround His head, and another orange reto with a brocaded border \nwas resting upon His shoulder.  In addition to this, a garland of roses \nwas hanging around His neck, tassels of roses had been placed upon \nHis head, and bãjubandh and gajarã had been tied around His arms.  \nShreeji Mahãrãj sat in a charming way facing north, while a sabhã of \nmunis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, gathered before \nHim. \n \n1.2 \nShobhã-Rãm Shãstri of Vadodarã asked Shreeji Mahãrãj a question:  \n“Mahãrãj, when a mumukshu attains nirvikalp samãdhi, he becomes \ngunãtit and an ekãntik bhakta of Bhagvãn.  Then, what becomes of a \nperson who does not attain nirvikalp samãdhi?” \n \n1.3 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Nirvikalp samãdhi is not only attained \nwhen the prãns are controlled.  There is another way to attain \nnirvikalp samãdhi, which I shall explain to you; so, please listen \ncarefully. \n \n1.4 \n“The Shreemad Bhãgvat states: \nVADTÃL \n- 596 - \natra sargo visargash-cha sthãnam poshanam-utayaha \nmanvanta-reshãnu-katha nirodho muktir-ãshrayaha \nThe ten characteristics of topics of discussion by which Bhagvãn can be \nrealised: sarg, visarg, sthãn, poshan, uti, manvantar-kathã, ishãnu-kathã, \nnirodh, mukti, ãshray. \n  \n \n“This verse explains that when a mumukshu establishes a firm belief \nof Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, who a person should take the refuge of and \nwho can be realised through the nine characteristics, then he will \nnever have a doubt.  For example, once a person has firmly realised \nthat this is a mango tree, then even if he is overcome by kãm, krodh, \nlobh, he will not entertain any doubts such as, ‘Is this a mango tree or \nnot?’  In the same way, regardless of whether a person has controlled \nhis prãns or not, if he has firm belief of the pratyaksha svarup of Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn – without any doubts whatsoever – then he has \nattained nirvikalp samãdhi. \n \n1.5 \n“However, someone may repeatedly have doubts in his mind about \nBhagvãn’s nature.  For example, he may think, ‘What must Bhagvãn’s \nsvarup be like in Akshardhãm?  What must His svarup be like in Shvet-\nDvip and Vaikunth?  When will I have the darshan of that svarup?’  He \ncontinues to have such doubts in his mind, but he does not feel \nfulfilled by realising that the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvãn that he \nhas attained is the cause of everything.  Even if he attains samãdhi by \nBhagvãn’s wish, his doubts are never eradicated.  No matter what he \nsees in samãdhi, he always desires to see something new; the desires \nof his mind are never suppressed.  Even if such a person experiences \nsamãdhi, it is savikalp samãdhi; and even if he does not experience \nsamãdhi, it is still savikalp samãdhi.  Therefore, such a person cannot \nbe called a gunãtit, ekãntik bhakta.  A person who does have firm \nnishchay in Bhagvãn, regardless of whether he has samãdhi or not, \ncan be said to have constant nirvikalp samãdhi.” \n \n1.6 \nThen, Dinã-Nãth Bhatt asked, “What will become of a person who \nfails to conquer the mind, despite attempting to eradicate the desires \nin his mind?” \nVADTÃL \n- 597 - \n1.7 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “As the war between the Kauravs and the \nPãndavs was set to begin, the Kauravs and the Pãndavs thought, ‘Let \nus engage in the battle in such a holy place that even if we are killed in \nthe fighting, our jeev will still benefit.’  With this thought in mind, they \neventually fought a battle, attained Dev-Lok, and obtained happiness \ngreater than that of ruling over a kingdom. \n \n1.8 \n“Therefore, regarding a person who takes up a fight with his mind – if \nhe wins, then he attains nirvikalp samãdhi and becomes an ekãntik \nbhakta of Bhagvãn.  However, if he should lose to his mind, he falls \nfrom his spiritual activities.  Then, maybe after one life or two lives or \neven after many lives, he will become an ekãntik bhakta; but, his \nefforts will not have been useless. \n \n1.9 \n“Therefore, a person who is wise should definitely develop hatred \ntowards his mind for the sake of his kalyãn.  Then, if he conquers his \nmind, he is sure to benefit; but, even if he is defeated by his mind, he \nwill eventually return to the path of enlightenment which is also \nbeneficial in the end.  Therefore, a person who aspires for kalyãn \nshould most certainly develop hatred towards his mind.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 1 || 201 || \n \n \nVadtãl – 2 \nRealising Bhagvãn Through The Five Shãstras \n \n2.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Kãrtik sud 13 [22nd November 1825], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead under a mango tree on the banks of Lake Gomti, north of \nthe mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in Vadtãl.  He was wearing a \nsurvãl made from yellow, silken cloth and a red dagli made from \nkinkhãb.  He had also tied a pãgh around His head using an orange \ncloth with a brocaded border.  An orange shelu with a brocaded \nVADTÃL \n- 598 - \nborder was placed upon His shoulder.  In addition to this, His pãgh \nwas decorated with garlands of champã flowers, and garlands of \nwhite flowers were hanging around His neck.  A sabhã of munis, as \nwell as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n2.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please begin a question-answer \ndiscussion.” \n \n2.3 \nThen, Kãndãsji Patel of the village Buvã folded his hands and asked, \n“Mahãrãj, by what means does Bhagvãn become pleased?” \n \n2.4 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If we do not insult Bhagvãn, then Bhagvãn \nbecomes pleased.  Then, you may ask, ‘What does it mean to criticise \nBhagvãn?’  Well, Bhagvãn is the all-doer of this world.  However, if a \nperson does not understand Him to be the all-doer and instead \nbelieves that it is Kãl that is the all-doer of this world, or that it is \nMãyã, or that it is karma, or that is the svabhãv that is the all-doer, \nthen he is insulting Bhagvãn.  This is because actually Bhagvãn is the \nall-doer.  To ignore this and to claim that only Kãl, karma, Mãyã, and \nsvabhãv are the all-doers of this world is serious against Bhagvãn. \n \n2.5 \n“For example, you are the Patel (chief of a village) of your village.  If \nsomeone does not acknowledge your status in the village, then he can \nbe said to be your slanderer.  Also, if someone does not accept the \ncontrol of an emperor of the world, but instead accepts the control of \na person who is not even a king, then that man is known as a \nslanderer of the emperor.  If a person writes and distributes letters \nstating, ‘Our king has no nose and ears; he has no hands or feet’, and \ntherefore, describes the king as being deformed even though he has a \nnormal body, then he is also known as a slanderer of the king.  \nSimilarly, Bhagvãn is complete, with limbs, hands, and feet.  There is \nnot the slightest deformation in any of His limbs.  He eternally \npossesses a definite svarup.  So, to say that He is not the all-doer and \nis nirãkãr, and that Kãl, Mãyã, karma are the cause of all – not \nBhagvãn – is equivalent to insulting Bhagvãn. \nVADTÃL \n- 599 - \n2.6 \n“A person who does not insult Bhagvãn in this way is said to have \nperformed perfect pujã of Bhagvãn.  Otherwise, without such an \nunderstanding, even if a person performs pujã by offering items like \nsandalwood paste and flowers, he is still a slanderer of Bhagvãn.  \nTherefore, Bhagvãn is only pleased upon a person who realises \nBhagvãn to possess a definite svarup and to be the creator, sustainer, \nand destroyer of the universe. \n \n2.7 \n“In the Veds, Bhagvãn Himself has described His nature in many \nways, but no one could understand it.  Then, the Sãnkhya shãstras \nprescribed the twenty-four tattvas and said that Bhagvãn is the \ntwenty-fifth tattva.  The ãchãrya of the Sãnkhya philosophy, Kapil \nMuni, thought, ‘The jeev behaves as if it is one with the three types of \nbodies (sthul, sukshma, and kãran) and it cannot remain separate from \nthem.  The ishvar also behaves as if it is one with its three bodies (virãt, \nsutrãtmã, and avyãkrut) and it too cannot remain separate from them.’  \nTherefore, the Sãnkhya shãstras count jeev and ishvar amongst the \ntwenty-four tattvas and claim Paramãtmã to be the twenty-fifth \ntattva. \n \n2.8 \n“The ãchãrya of the Yog shãstras, Hiranyagarbh Rushi, explains that \nthere are twenty-four tattvas, and that jeev and ishvar are the twenty-\nfifth tattva; but, Paramãtmã is the twenty-sixth. \n \n2.9 \n“This is how the Sãnkhya shãstras and the Yog shãstras described \nBhagvãn’s nature; still, no one attained understanding of the nature \nof the Bhagvãn as He is.  So, according to the Sãnkhya shãstras, it was \nconcluded, ‘Whatever is greater than the twenty-four elements is \nsatya’; and according to the Yog shãstras, it was concluded, \n‘Paramãtmã, who is greater than jeev and ishvar, who themselves is \nbeyond the twenty-four elements, is satya’.  In this way, through these \ntwo philosophies, the nature of Bhagvãn was realised.  However, is \nthat Bhagvãn black, or yellow?  Is He tall, or short?  Is He sãkãr, or \nnirãkãr?  That was not realised. \nVADTÃL \n- 600 - \n2.10 “Then, Vãsudev Bhagvãn composed the Panch-Rãtra Tãntra, in which \nhe explained, ‘In his own Akshardhãm, Shree Krishna Purushottam \nBhagvãn eternally possesses a divya sãkãr murti.  This Bhagvãn gives \ndarshan five times to the countless niranna-muktas of Shvet-Dvip.  In \nVaikunth, that same Bhagvãn assumes a four-armed form, holding a \nshankh, a chakra, a gadã, and a padma.  Along with Him is Lakshmiji.  \nHe is also served by Vishvaksen and other pãrshads.  It is that same \nBhagvãn who is worthy of being offered pujã, worthy of worship and \nworthy of attainment.  It is that same Bhagvãn who assumes the \navatars of Ram and Krishna, and who appears in the four forms of \nVãsudev, Sankarshan, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha’.  In this way, \nVãsudev Bhagvãn explained that Bhagvãn possesses a sãkãr murti. \n \n2.11 “Then, Nãradji revised that same Panch-Rãtra Tãntra, after which it \ncame to be known as the Nãrad Panch-Rãtra.  In that, Bhagvãn’s \nsvarup was explained in such a way that not even the slightest doubt \nremained.  Also, Shivji explained the four-armed svarup and eight-\narmed svarup of Bhagvãn in the Pashupãt-Shãstra. \n \n2.12 “Therefore, the Shreemad Bhãgvat states: \n \nnãrãyana-parã vedã devã nãrãyan-ãngajãhã \nnãrãyana-parã lokã nãrãyana-parã makhãhã \nnãrãyana-paro yogo nãrãyana-param tapaha \nnãrãyana-param gnãnam nãrãyana-parã gatihi \nThe Veds are devoted to Nãrãyan, and the essence of the Veds is Nãrãyan; the \ndevs are all formed from the svarup of Nãrãyan; the loks are all devoted to \nNãrãyan, and all the loks are pervaded by Nãrãyan; all yagnas are devoted to \nNãrãyan.  All yog is devoted to Nãrãyan; all tap is devoted to Nãrãyan; all \ngnãn is devoted to Nãrãyan; and Nãrãyan is the objective of all activities. \n \nvãsudeva-parã vedã vãsudeva-parã makhãhã \nvãsudeva-parã yogã vãsudeva-parãhã kriyãhã \nvãsudeva-param gnãnam vãsudeva-param tapaha \nvãsudeva-paro dharmo vãsudeva-parã gatihi \nThe Veds are devoted to Vãsudev, and the essence of the Veds is Vãsudev; all \nyagnas are devoted to Vãsudev; all yog is devoted to Vãsudev; all activities are \nVADTÃL \n- 601 - \ndevoted to Vãsudev.  All gnãn is devoted to Vãsudev; all tap is devoted to \nVãsudev; all dharma is devoted to Vãsudev; and Vãsudev is the objective of all \nactivities. \n \n2.13 “Therefore, the five shãstras have described the nature of Shree \nKrishna Vãsudev only.  Only a person who realises Bhagvãn through \nthese five shãstras can be said to possess total gnãn.  For example, \nonly when a person sees with his eyes does he come to know that \nmilk is white; only when he smells with his nose does he come to \nknow its smell; only when he touches it with his finger does he come \nto know whether it is hot or cold; and only when he tastes it with his \ntongue does he come to know its taste.  In this way, only when milk is \ntested through all the indriyas can a person totally know its nature; it \ncannot be totally known through one indriya alone.  Similarly, a \nperson realises Bhagvãn’s nature totally when he realises it through \nthe five shãstras.  To have such knowledge is called total gnãn. \n \n2.14 “Bhagvãn \nis \npleased \nonly \nupon \nsomeone \nwho \nhas \nsuch \nunderstanding; there is no other means of pleasing Him.  Therefore, \nonly a person who has this understanding can be said to possess total \ngnãn, and Bhagvãn becomes extremely pleased only upon such a \nperson.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 2 || 202 || \n \n \nVadtãl – 3 \nBhakti Coupled With Bhagvãn’s Greatness \n \n3.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Kãrtik vad 11 [6th December 1825], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a sinhãsan in the \nmandir of Shree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in Vadtãl.  He was dressed entirely \nin white clothes.  He was also wearing garlands of roses around His \nneck, and tassels decorated the pãgh upon His head.  A sabhã of all \nthe munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \nVADTÃL \n- 602 - \n3.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “In our Uddhav Sampradãy a person who \nhas dharma, gnãn, vairãgya, and bhakti towards Bhagvãn is called an \nekãntik bhakta, and only he is worthy of being made renowned in our \nsatsang.  However, if these four qualities are not perfect and only one \nis predominant, then which of the four is the best, and incorporates \nthe other three?”  \n \n3.3 \nGopãlãnand Swãmi and Muktãnand Swãmi replied, “Mahãrãj, dharma \nis the best, because if there is dharma then the other three qualities \nwill eventually develop in that person.” \n \n3.4 \nTo this, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Dharma may be present even in \nthose who are vimukhs.  Does that mean that we should make them \nrenowned in satsang?” \n \n3.5 \nHearing this argument, no one could give a reply to the question.  \nShreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “If a person has bhakti towards \nBhagvãn coupled with knowledge of His greatness, he will never fall \nfrom dharma – even if he has a lesser degree of ãtmã-nishthã, \nvairãgya, and dharma.  This is because a person who realises \nBhagvãn’s greatness, thinks, ‘If Brahmã and all the other devs follow \nBhagvãn’s ãgnã, then how can I not follow His ãgnã?’  Bearing this in \nmind, he always abides by the niyams prescribed by Bhagvãn.” \n \n3.6 \nThen, Shuk Muni asked, “If bhakti coupled with the knowledge of \nBhagvãn’s greatness alone is enough, why are all four qualities \nprescribed as essential, and not just bhakti alone?” \n \n3.7 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a person has intense bhakti for Bhagvãn \ncoupled with the knowledge of His greatness, then all three are \nincorporated in bhakti alone.  But, if his bhakti is of a medium \nintensity, then the other three are not incorporated within it.  \nTherefore, it is said, ‘A person who has the type of bhakti which include \nall four qualities can be called an ekãntik bhakta’. \nVADTÃL \n- 603 - \n3.8 \n“Pruthu Rãjã had such extraordinary bhakti.  When Bhagvãn awarded \na vardãn upon him, he asked for ten thousand ears in order to hear \nkathãs related to Bhagvãn; he did not ask for anything else.  Also, \nsome gopis who were forbidden to go and play rãs discarded their \nbodies and went to Shree Krishna in spirit.  If a person has such \nextraordinary bhakti, then the other three qualities are all \nincorporated in bhakti alone.” \n \n3.9 \nBrahmãnand Swãmi then asked, “By what means can such \nextraordinary bhakti be attained?” \n \n3.10 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “It is attained by serving a great sant.  \nThere are four types of great sant.  One is like a small flame, the \nsecond is like a torch, the third is like lightning, and the fourth is like \nthe vadvãnal fire. \n \n3.11 “A person, who is like a small flame, is extinguished by the wind in \nthe form of the vishays.  A person, who is like a torch, is extinguished \nby stronger gusts of wind in the form of the vishays.  A person, who is \nlike lightning, is not extinguished even by rainwater in the form of \nmãyã.  However, vadvãnal fire stays in the ocean without being \nextinguished by the ocean water; it drinks the sea water and excretes \nit in the form of sweet water; in turn, the clouds carry this water and \nshower it upon the world; and from this, many types of tastes are \nformed.  Similarly, a great sant, like the vadvãnal fire, transforms \neven the ‘salty’ jeevs who are like the saline sea water, into ‘sweet’ \njeevs. \n \n3.12 “Of the four types of great sant just described, if a person serves \nsomeone who is like lightning or the vadvãnal fire – by thought, \nword, and deed, and while staying within his dharma – then bhakti \ncoupled with the knowledge of Bhagvãn’s greatness develops in that \nperson. \n \n3.13 “Also, a person should realise that the person who is like lightning is \nknown as Bhagvãn’s ekãntik sãdhu – who is in sãdhan-dashã.  The \nVADTÃL \n- 604 - \nperson who is like the vadvãnal fire is known as Bhagvãn’s great \nekãntik sant – who has attained siddh-dashã.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 3 || 203 || \n \n \nVadtãl – 4 \nThe Thirty Qualities Of A Sant \n \n4.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Mãgshar sud 10 [19th December 1825], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in the mandir of Shree \nLakshmi-Nãrãyan in Vadtãl.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  \nA sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \n4.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please being a question-answer \ndiscussion.” \n \n4.3 \nThen, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “For a bhakta of Bhagvãn who has \ntaken the path of bhakti, which one spiritual activity includes all the \nother activities for kalyãn?” \n \n4.4 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “All the spiritual activities for attaining \nkalyãn are included in keeping the company – by thought, word, and \ndeed – of a sant who possesses the thirty qualities of a sãdhu.” \n \n4.5 \nAfter replying to the question, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Suppose there \nis an ekãntik bhakta yogi who realises that the philosophy of both the \nSãnkhya shãstras and the Yog shãstras is based upon only Vãsudev-\nNãrãyan.  By what means does that yogi fix his vrutti on Bhagvãn’s \nmurti?  How does he control his mind?  How does he keep his vrutti \nfacing inwards?  How does he keep his vrutti facing outwards?  By \nwhich of his yogic abilities does he separate himself from the \nobstacles of disturbing thoughts and desires, as well as from the \nabsorption of sleep?  Please answer these questions.” \nVADTÃL \n- 605 - \n \n4.6 \nThen, Muktãnand Swãmi and Gopãlãnand Swãmi attempted to \nanswer these questions to the best of their ability, but neither of \nthem was able to give a satisfactory reply.  So, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, \n“When water goes into a fountain, it first revolves in a spiral and then \nspurts upwards; in the same way, the vrutti of the jeev revolves in a \nspiral in the antah-karans, which acts like the fountain, and then \nspurts out through the five indriyas.  A yogi does this in two ways:  \nWith one vrutti, he thinks of Shree Vãsudev Bhagvãn who resides in \nhis heart as a witness.  With the second vrutti he faces outwards \nthrough his eyes, and he thinks about Bhagvãn who is outside.  He \nthinks of the whole murti from head to toe; he does not only think of \na single part of the body.  Just as when a person looks at a large \nmandir, he sees it completely as a whole; or when a person looks at a \nlarge mountain, he sees it totally; similarly, the yogi sees Bhagvãn’s \nmurti in the same way, but he does not see each part of Bhagvãn’s \nbody separately. \n \n4.7 \n“When he observes the murti at a distance through his eyes, if he sees \nsome other object besides Bhagvãn, then he draws that murti of \nBhagvãn closer and observes it at the tip of his nose.  Even after \ndoing this, if he still sees some object nearby, then he observes the \nmurti of Bhagvãn between his eyebrows.  While doing this, if he feels \nlazy or sleepy, then he would again observe the murti of Bhagvãn \nbefore his eyes.  Then, in the same way that a child flies a kite, he \nwould fly a kite (Bhagvãn’s murti) with a string (vrutti).  He would \nmake it rise upwards, then bring it down again, and then make it \nsweep from side to side.  Using his yogic powers in this way, when he \nbecomes alert, he would again observe the murti at the tip of his \nnose, and from there he would bring it between his eyebrows, and \nthen he would draw it into his heart.  Then, he would merge together \nboth the murti of Bhagvãn that resides in his heart as a witness, and \nthe murti of Bhagvãn that is outside.  At this point, the two vruttis of \nthe antah-karans become one. \nVADTÃL \n- 606 - \n4.8 \n“While doing this, if he feels lazy or sleepy again, then he would bring \nthe murti outside again using the two types of vruttis.  In the same \nway as with his eyes, he would use his ears, hands, tongue, and nose \nto perfect yog.  Also, he would observe Bhagvãn’s murti with his man, \nbuddhi, chitt, and ahankãr.  Then, by using the sãnkhya thought \nprocess, he would distinguish himself from his indriyas and antah-\nkarans and would observe only the murti of Bhagvãn in his chaitanya.  \nWhile he is beholding the form, whether it be inside or outside, if \nsome disturbance regarding worldly affairs obstructs him, then he \nwould remove the problem while continuing to observe the murti; \nbut, he would not abandon his yogic activities because of the \ndisturbance.  This is how a yogi with such yogic powers behaves.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 4 || 204 || \n \n \nVadtãl – 5 \nA Bhakta Should Not Perceive Mãyã In Bhagvãn \n \n5.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Mãgshar vad 4, [29th December 1825], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting facing north on a \ndecorated seat under a mango tree along the banks of Lake Gomti, \nnorth of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in Vadtãl.  He was \ndressed entirely in extremely fine, white clothes, and He had several \ngarlands of roses hanging around His neck.  Bunches of two large \nroses had been placed upon His ears, and tassels of roses decorated \nHis pãgh.  A sabhã of all the munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n5.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please ask complex questions in order to \nrelieve everyone’s tiredness.”  Having said that, Mahãrãj put a pillow \nfacing west and lay down. \n \n5.3 \nThen, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Shree Krishna Bhagvãn has said:  \n \nVADTÃL \n- 607 - \ndaivee hyeshã guna-mayee mama mãyã duratyayã \nmãm-eva ye prapadyante mãyãm-etãm taranti te \n \n \n“This verse means, ‘A person who attains me will break through my \nMãyã, which is composed of the three gun, and which cannot otherwise \nbe broken through even by suffering hardships’.  However, even after a \nperson has attained Bhagvãn, he is still disturbed by thoughts and \ndesires in his heart during the worship of Bhagvãn.  What else, \nbesides Mãyã, could be causing this?  That is the question.” \n \n5.4 \nShreeji Mahãrãj sat upright from His lying posture, and with great \ncompassion said, “Of the three gun of Mãyã, tamo-gun is predominant \nin the five bhuts, and the five tan-mãtras; rajo-gun is predominant in \nthe ten indriyas, the buddhi, and the prãns; and sattva-gun is \npredominant in the man and the presiding devs of the indriyas and \nantah-karans.  In the past, all those who have become bhaktas have \npossessed the products of the three gun – the bhuts, the indriyas, the \nantah-karans, and their presiding devs.  Therefore, the answer to the \nquestion is as follows:  A person who has the firm belief of Bhagvãn – \nwho has realised Bhagvãn completely by believing that there are no \nmãyik qualities in His svarup, and that Bhagvãn is greater than Mãyã \nand the products of Mãyã (the three gun) – has gone beyond \nBhagvãn’s Mãyã.  Even though he has the products of the gun of mãyã \nwithin him (the bhuts, the indriyas, the antah-karans, and their \npresiding devs, each of which carries out its respective activities) he \nis still said to have gone beyond Mãyã.  This is because even though \nthe products of Mãyã are within him, he still realises that the \npratyaksha svarup of Shree Vãsudev Bhagvãn, who is worthy to be \nworshipped by him, is beyond the gun of Mãyã; therefore, he himself \nshould also be known to have gone beyond Mãyã. \n \n5.5 \n“Even the shãstras acknowledge that the gun seem to have influenced \nall, including the devs and the rushis.  Does that imply that they \ncannot be called muktas?  Also, does that imply that they cannot be \nsaid to have gone beyond Mãyã?  In fact, they are all muktas, and they \nVADTÃL \n- 608 - \nhave all gone beyond Mãyã.  If we do not answer in this way then \nthere is no other possible solution to that question.  Therefore, this is \nthe only answer.” \n \n5.6 \nThen, Nityãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, people go to seek the refuge \nof Bhagvãn.  Then, what are the characteristics of having the refuge of \nBhagvãn?” \n \n5.7 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Bhagvãn has said in the Geetã,  \n \nsarva-dharmãn-parityajya mãm-ekam sharanam vraja \naham tvã sarva-pãpebhyo mokshayishyãmi mã shuchaha \n \n \n“In this verse he says, ‘Abandon all other forms of dharma and \nsurrender only to me.  I shall deliver you from all sins, so do not grieve’.  \nA person who has such a firm refuge of Bhagvãn, even if he were to \nexperience pain equivalent to that of final destruction, he would not \nbelieve anyone else to be his guardian against such misery, except \nBhagvãn.  Moreover, whatever happiness he wishes for, he seeks to \nattain only from Bhagvãn.  He does not consider anyone but Bhagvãn \nto be the source of happiness.  Moreover, he behaves only according \nto the wishes of Bhagvãn.  Such a person can be known to have taken \nrefuge in Bhagvãn.  It is he who can be called a firm bhakta of \nBhagvãn.” \n \n5.8 \nThen, Nãjã Bhakta asked, “How can a person recognise someone who, \nwhen he speaks, shows that he has nishchay in Bhagvãn like that of a \nbhakta, but does not truly have the total refuge of Bhagvãn?” \n \n5.9 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Only after staying together and working \ntogether can a person recognise the strength or weakness of the \nnishchay of a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  A person who has little nishchay \nwould become distressed and find a path out of satsang.  He would \nseek privacy where he could engage in worship to his capacity, but he \nwould not be able to tolerate the pressures of living in the company \nVADTÃL \n- 609 - \nof bhaktas.  Therefore, refuge of Bhagvãn is of three levels:  uttam, \nmadhyam, and kanishth.  Due to this, there are three levels of \nbhaktas.” \n \n5.10 Then, Nityãnand Swãmi asked, “Can a bhakta who is of the kanishth \nlevel eradicate his deficiency and become a bhakta of the uttam level \nin this very life, or not?” \n \n5.11 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Just as a bhakta performs the mãnsi pujã of \nBhagvãn, a person should also performs the mãnsi pujã of the uttam \nbhakta along with Bhagvãn, by offering him the prasãd of Bhagvãn; \nand just as a bhakta prepares a thãl for Bhagvãn, a person should also \nprepare a thãl for Bhagvãn’s uttam bhakta and serve it to him; and \njust as a bhakta donates five rupees to Bhagvãn, a person should also \ndonates money to the great sant.  Then, by performing sevã of \nBhagvãn and His sant, who possesses the highest qualities, with \nextreme love – even if he is a bhakta of the kanishth type and was \ndestined to become a bhakta of the highest type after two lives, or \nafter four lives, or after ten lives, or after a hundred lives – he will \nbecome a bhakta of the uttam level in this very life.  These are the \nrewards of the sevã of Bhagvãn and His bhaktas.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 5 || 205 || \n \n \nVadtãl – 6 \nThe Jeev Remains Within Mãyã After Destruction \n \n6.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Mãgshar vad 11 [4th January 1826], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a platform in front \nof the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in Vadtãl.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  Garlands of flowers had been placed \naround His neck, and tassels of flowers were also hanging from His \nVADTÃL \n- 610 - \npãgh.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n6.2 \nThen, Chiman-Rãvji asked, “Mahãrãj, initially, at the time of \ndestruction, the jeevs with their kãran bodies were absorbed within \nMãyã.  Then, at the time of creation, the jeevs attained their sthul and \nsukshma bodies.  Also, a variety of life (devs, humans, animals, and \nplants) was created.  Was this due to karmas?  Or was it due to \nBhagvãn’s wish?  If we say that it was due to karmas, then that would \nprove the Jain philosophy to be true.  On the other hand, if we say \nthat it was due to Bhagvãn’s wish, then it would suggest that Bhagvãn \nis biased and not compassionate.  Therefore, please grace us by \ntelling us how things really are.” \n \n6.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj said, “You have not been able to ask the question \nproperly.  The sthul and sukshma bodies are both closely associated \nwith the kãran body in the same way that a tree is closely associated \nwith its seed.  That is why it is called the kãran body.  This kãran \nbody is a form of avidyã; it is without a beginning; and it retains its \nsanchit karmas.  Just as a seed and its shell have an eternal \nrelationship, and just as pruthvi and smell have an eternal \nrelationship, similarly, the jeev and the kãran body have an eternal \nrelationship.  Just as when planted seeds sprout upwards after \ncoming into contact with rainwater, similarly, during the period of \ncreation, the jeevs, which had resided within Mãyã together with \ntheir kãran bodies, attain various types of bodies according to their \nindividual karmas by the will of Bhagvãn, the giver of the rewards of \nkarmas. \n \n6.4 \n“However, the Jains, who are nãstiks, claim that only karmas are the \ncause of this, but they do not describe Bhagvãn as the giver of the \nfruits of karmas.  However, in reality, this belief of those nãstiks is \nwrong.  Therefore, if someone claims that kãl is the only influencing \nforce, then he is not correct; or, if someone claims that karma is the \nVADTÃL \n- 611 - \nonly influencing force, then he is not correct; or, if someone claims \nthat Bhagvãn’s wish is the only influencing force, then even he is not \ncorrect.  The shãstras would describe the predominance of whichever \ninfluence is predominant at that time; but that same influence should \nnot be accepted for all situations. \n \n6.5 \n“This is because after the world was created, in the first Satya-Yug, \neveryone’s wishes came true, all were brãhmans, and a child would \nbe born merely by mentally wishing for one.  There was a kalpa-\nvruksh in every home, and all people worshipped only Bhagvãn.  \nThen, with the arrival of Tretã-Yug, people’s wishes were no longer \nfulfilled; only when a person went and stood under a kalpa-vruksh \ndid his wishes become fulfilled; and only after touching a woman \nwould a child be conceived.  Then, when Dvãpar-Yug arrived, \nchildren were born only after physical association with a woman.  \nHowever, the ways of Satya-Yug and Tretã-Yug are not to be found in \nall Satya-Yugs and Tretã-Yugs; they were found only in the first \nSatya-Yug and the first Tretã-Yug. \n \n6.6 \n“Therefore, when there is the predominance of pleasant kãl, it \ndiminishes the power of the impure karmas of the jeevs.  However, \nwhen a terrible famine strikes, everyone suffers; or when there is a \nhorrendous war, hundreds of thousands of people are killed at once.  \nIn these cases were everyone’s pleasant karmas suddenly used up at \nthe same time?  Instead, it is the intense power of unpleasant kãl that \novercomes the force of the pleasant karmas of the jeevs.  So, when the \ninfluence of intense kãl prevails, karmas have no influence; due to the \ninfluence of kãl, karmas that should have resulted in happiness lead \nto misery, and karmas that should have resulted in long life lead to \ndeath.  In this way, when the influence of a strong kãl is prevalent, \neverything occurs due to kãl.  This is mentioned in the shãstras. \n \n6.7 \n“However, when many people become ekãntik bhaktas of Bhagvãn, \nthen Satya-Yug prevails even in Kali-Yug.  In these circumstances, the \nVADTÃL \n- 612 - \nshãstras describe the strength of the pleasant karmas that result from \nthe ekãntik bhaktas performing bhakti of Bhagvãn, but the strength of \nkãl is not mentioned. \n \n6.8 \n“Without understanding this principle, those who believe in the \nnãstik philosophy describes that only karmas are the cause of \neverything; but, they do not realise that the principle is in reference \nto the strength of the karmas of ekãntik bhaktas of Bhagvãn.  \nHowever, karmas of vimukhs are not said to have such strength.  \nWhen Bhagvãn takes birth with the wish, ‘During this lifespan, I wish \nto grant kalyãn to all jeevs, both worthy and unworthy, who come into \ncontact with my murti’, then kãl and karma have no influence \nwhatsoever.  At that time, only Bhagvãn’s influence prevails.  When \nBhagvãn assumed the avatar of Krishna, the evil Putnã tried to poison \nBhagvãn; still, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn gave her the same fate as His \nmother Yashodã.  There were other evil demons that came to kill \nBhagvãn; but, even they were granted Akshardhãm by Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn.  Others were also granted kalyãn according to the feelings \nby which they were associated with Shree Krishna Bhagvãn.  \nTherefore, in those instances, only Bhagvãn’s influence is said to be \nprevalent, but neither kãl nor karma is said to have any influences.  \nTherefore, a person should interpret situations according to the \ncircumstances in which they occur.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 6 || 206 || \n \n \nVadtãl – 7 \nThe Characteristics Of Religious And Demonic People \n \n7.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Mãgshar vad 14 [7th January 1826], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a platform in front of the mandir of \nShree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in Vadtãl.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \nVADTÃL \n- 613 - \n7.2 \nIn the sabhã, the bhaktas were talking about Bhagvãn amongst \nthemselves, when the topic arose that there are two types of people:  \nreligious and demonic.  Of these, religious people always become \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn, whereas the demonic will always remain \nopposed to Bhagvãn. \n \n7.3 \nThen, Chiman-Rãvji asked a question:  “Mahãrãj is there any \npossibility of a demonic person becoming religious?” \n \n7.4 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A demonic person most certainly does not \nbecome religious.  This is because he has a demonic nature from \nbirth.  If such a person somehow enters satsang, he still does not lose \nhis demonic nature.  Then, when he leaves his physical body after \nstaying in satsang, he is absorbed into brahm and then emerges out \nagain.  Only after he does so countless times is his demonic nature \ndestroyed; otherwise, it is not destroyed.” \n \n7.5 \nThen, Shobhã-Rãm Shãstri asked, “Mahãrãj, what is Bhagvãn’s anvay \nnature, and what is His vyatirek nature?” \n \n7.6 \nShreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The principle of anvay-vyatirek is not that \nBhagvãn has become half anvay within Mãyã and half vyatirek svarup \nHis dhãm.  Instead, Bhagvãn’s svarup is such that He is anvay within \nMãyã, and at the same time, He is vyatirek.  Bhagvãn is not afraid, \n‘What if I enter Mãyã and then become impure?’  Instead, when \nBhagvãn associates with Mãyã, even Mãyã becomes like Akshardhãm; \nand if He associates with the twenty-four tattvas, then they also \nbecome brahm-rup.  Therefore, the Shreemad Bhãgvat states: \n \ndhãmnã svena sadã nirasta-kuhakam satyam param dheemahi \nWe perform dhyãn upon Bhagvãn, who destroyed the deception via His own \nsvarup, in the form of the products of Mãyã.  This is the supremely satya \nsvarup of Bhagvãn. \n \n“In this way, there are countless such statements which describe \nBhagvãn’s svarup. \nVADTÃL \n- 614 - \n7.7 \n“For example, there is ãkãsh in the seed of a tree; and when a tree \ngrows from that seed, ãkãsh will still remain within all of its \nbranches, leaves, flowers, and fruits in its anvay form.  However, \nwhen the tree is cut, ãkãsh is not cut along with it; and when the tree \nis burnt, ãkãsh is not burnt.  In the same way, Bhagvãn is anvay \nwithin Mãyã and the entities that have evolved from it; but, He is also \nvyatirek from it just like ãkãsh.  This is the anvay-vyatirek nature of \nBhagvãn’s svarup.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 7 || 207 || \n \n \nVadtãl – 8 \nBecoming Like Bhagvãn \nA Spider’s Web \n \n8.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Posh sud 4 [12th January 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a platform in front of the \nmandir of Shree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in Vadtãl.  He was dressed entirely \nin white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n8.2 \nIn the sabhã, Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in a meditative posture and \nthinking.  Some of the munis were singing kirtans to the \naccompaniment of a dukad and sarodã.  He gave darshan in this way \nfor a short while.  Then, He opened His eyes and said, “Everyone \nplease listen as I wish to speak to you.  The vrutti of these eyes is \nformless; but, if some solid object comes in its way, that vrutti is \nobstructed.  Therefore, that vrutti is actually physical and is \ncomposed predominantly of the tattva of pruthvi.  When a bhakta of \nBhagvãn fixes that vrutti on Bhagvãn’s murti, the vrutti initially \nappears like a thin yellow rope.  Just as a spider stretches its web \nfrom one pillar to another, and then sometimes goes to one pillar, \nthen to the other pillar, or sometimes sits between the two pillars, \nVADTÃL \n- 615 - \nsimilarly, the jeev is like the spider; Bhagvãn’s murti is one of the \npillars, the antah-karans are the other pillar, and the vrutti is the web.  \nThrough that vrutti, a meditating yogi sometimes becomes absorbed \nin Bhagvãn’s murti; at times, he stays within his own antah-karans; \nand at other times, he stays between his antah-karans and Bhagvãn. \n \n8.3 \n“While doing this, when the yellow vrutti, which is composed \npredominantly of the tattva of pruthvi, becomes predominantly jal, it \nappears to be white; when it becomes predominantly tej, it appears \nto be red; when it becomes predominantly vãyu, it appears to be \ngreen; and when it becomes predominantly ãkãsh, it appears to be \ndark.  Finally, when the vrutti sheds the predominance of the five \nbhuts and becomes nirgun, it appears to be extremely radiant and \nassumes the svarup of Bhagvãn. \n \n8.4 \n“Therefore, a person who tries to maintain his vrutti on Bhagvãn’s \nsvarup in this way should remain perfectly pure.  For example, when \na person wishes to offer pujã to a dev, the dev accepts the pujã only \nafter the person becomes as pure as the dev.  Similarly, a person who \nkeeps his vrutti on Bhagvãn’s svarup should realise his own self to be \ndistinct from the three bodies (sthul, sukshma, and kãran), in \naccordance with the method prescribed in the Sãnkhya shãstras; and \nonly after attaining ãtmã-nishthã, should he fix his vrutti on \nBhagvãn’s svarup.  While repeatedly fixing his vrutti in this way, \nwhen his vrutti is eventually absorbed into Bhagvãn’s svarup, that \nstate has been defined as sleep for a yogi performing dhyãn; but, a \nyogi’s sleep is never like the state sushupti.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 8 || 208 || \n \n \nVadtãl – 9 \nHow Can A Person Experience The Nirgun Bliss Of Bhagvãn? \n \n9.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Posh sud 8 [16th January 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \nVADTÃL \n- 616 - \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a platform in front of the \nmandir of Shree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in Vadtãl.  He was dressed entirely \nin white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n9.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked the munis, “Just as a person can \nexperience the three kinds of mãyik pleasures – rãjas, tãmasi, and \nsãttvik – in the three mental states, how can he experience the nirgun \nbliss of Bhagvãn?” \n \n9.3 \nAll the munis conferred amongst themselves in order to answer the \nquestion, but they were unable to do so satisfactorily. \n \n9.4 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Suppose there is ãkãsh alone, without \nthe other four bhuts.  Also, suppose that in that ãkãsh there are many \nmoons as there are stars.  Then, the intensity of that light would be \nequal to the intensity of the divine light of Chidãkãsh.  The murti of \nBhagvãn is always seated at the centre of that Chidãkãsh. \n \n9.5 \n“When a person attains samãdhi of that form, then even if he \nexperiences it for only a moment, the person who is engaged in \nworship feels, ‘I have enjoyed the bliss of Bhagvãn in samãdhi for \nthousands of  years’.  This is how a person experiences the nirgun \nbliss of Bhagvãn’s svarup.  On the other hand, even if a person \nindulges in mãyik pleasures for a long time, he feels as if it was just \nfor a moment.  Therefore, the nirgun bliss of Bhagvãn is eternal and \nimperishable, whereas the mãyik pleasures are perishable.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 9 || 209 || \n \n \nVadtãl – 10 \nRealising Bhagvãn In The Svarup Of A King Or Sãdhu \n \n10.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh sud 11 [19th January 1826],  Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \nVADTÃL \n- 617 - \ncylindrical pillow which had been placed on a wooden bedstead \nunder the neem tree outside the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in \nVadtãl.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, \nas well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n10.2 Then, Bhagu-Bhãi Pãtidãr of the village Bhãdran arrived in the sabhã \nand asked, “Mahãrãj, how can the jeev attain kalyãn?” \n \n10.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Bhagvãn assumes an avatãr on this earth in \none of two svarups: the svarup of the king, or in the svarup of a sãdhu.  \nWhen He assumes an avatãr upon the earth in the svarup of a king, \nHe possesses the thirty-nine characteristics of a king; and when He \nassumes an avatãr upon the earth in the svarup of a sãdhu, He \npossesses the thirty characteristics of a sãdhu. \n \n10.4 “When Bhagvãn appears in the svarup a king, He is educated in the \nsixty-four sciences, arts, and skills of a royal household; the four \nmethods of ruling  (reconciling with enemies, suppressing enemies, \ninstigating divisions within enemies, and punishing enemies); as well \nas the nine types of sentiments and emotions, such as affection, \nhumour, sadness, courage, and tranquillity.  However, when Bhagvãn \nappears in the svarup of a sãdhu, he does not have these \ncharacteristics.  When Bhagvãn is in the svarup of a king, He may \neven take to hunting to survive in times of disaster.  He may punish \nthieves by strangling them, and He may also keep many women in \nHis household.  However, in the svarup of a sãdhu, Bhagvãn strictly \nfollows a non-violent lifestyle; He would not even pluck a blade of \ngreen grass.  Also, He would not touch even wooden statues of \nwomen or paintings of women.  Therefore, the behaviour of Bhagvãn \nin the svarup of a sãdhu is not the same as that of Bhagvãn in the \nsvarup of a king. \n \n10.5 “The thirty-nine characteristics of Bhagvãn’s avatãrs in the svarup of \na king (Shree Krishna and Shree Rãm) are listed in the first skandh of \nthe Shreemad Bhãgvat through the discussion between Pruthvi and \nVADTÃL \n- 618 - \nDharma.  The thirty characteristics of Bhagvãn’s avatãrs in the svarup \nof a sãdhu (Dattãtrey and Kapil-Dev) are listed in the eleventh skandh \nthrough the discussion between Shree Krishna Bhagvãn and Uddhav. \n \n10.6 “Therefore, a person who desires kalyãn should recognise Bhagvãn \nthrough these characteristics and seek refuge of that Bhagvãn.  He \nshould have complete faith in Him, and He should perform His bhakti \nwhile following His ãgnã.  This is the only means of attaining kalyãn. \n \n10.7 “However, when Bhagvãn is not pratyaksha on this earth, a person \nshould seek the refuge of a sant who has the realisation of Bhagvãn – \nbecause the jeev can also attain kalyãn through him.  When such a \nsant is not present, He should keep firm faith in Bhagvãn’s murti and \nperform bhakti while observing svadharma, as this can also grant \nkalyãn to the jeev.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 10 || 210 || \n \n \nVadtãl – 11 \nThe Destruction Of The Jeev \n \n11.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh sud Punam [23rd January 1826], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a wooden bedstead under \nthe neem tree outside the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in \nVadtãl.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  He was also \nwearing garlands of white flowers around His neck.  In addition to \nthis, bunches of flowers were placed above His ears, and tassels of \nflowers were also hanging from His pãgh.  A sabhã of all the munis, as \nwell as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n11.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “My nature is such that I feel extremely \nafraid of harming any of the following:  Bhagvãn, a bhakta of \nBhagvãn, a brãhman, and a person who is humble.  Other than these \nVADTÃL \n- 619 - \nfour, I am afraid of no one.  This is because even if a person were to \nharm anyone else, his body would be destroyed; the jeev would not \nbe destroyed.  However, if a person harms one of these four, then his \njeev is also destroyed.” \n \n11.3 Hearing his, Muktãnand Swãmi questioned, “Mahãrãj, the jeev is said \nto be indestructible.  Then, what should one understand by its \n‘destruction’?” \n \n11.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A jeev that attains a jad svarup, such as the \nbody of a mountain, will never attain kalyãn.  This should be \nunderstood as the ‘destruction’ of that jeev.  Therefore, anyone who \nseeks kalyãn should never harm Bhagvãn, a bhakta of Bhagvãn, a \nbrãhman, and a person who is humble. \n \n11.5 “Also, a person should never keep mãn of any sort before Bhagvãn or \nHis bhakta.  This is because mãn is the cause of krodh, matsar, irshyã, \nand slander.  In fact, even the bhakti of a person with mãn is said to \nbe demonic.  Moreover, if a person oppresses a bhakta of Bhagvãn, \nthen even if he himself is a bhakta, he should be known to be a \ndemon.  My nature is such that I hate even the sight of a person who \nharms a brãhman, a humble person, or a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  Such a \nperson will never attain my company, either in this lok or in other \nloks.” \n \n11.6 Having spoken in this way, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked for two kirtans to \nbe sung.  The first was ‘Mãrã Harjishu Het Na Dise Re, Tene Gher Shid \nJaiye...’ – why should a person even visit the home of a person who has \nno love for my lord?  The second was ‘Mãrã Vahãljishu Vãlap Dise Re, \nTeno Sang Kem Tajiye...’ – why should a person abandon the company \nof a person who has love for my lord?  Shreeji Mahãrãj then gave an \nãgnã that all satsangis should learn these two kirtans, and added, “A \nperson should constantly sing these two kirtans and remember their \nmessage.” \nVADTÃL \n- 620 - \n11.7 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj got up and sat on a platform in front of the \nmandir of Shree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan. \n \n11.8 Gopãlãnand Swãmi then asked, “Why is it that despite reading the \nsix-shãstras, the Purãns, and other shãstras, the pandits of the world \nstill do not understand the greatness of Bhagvãn and His sant as it \nreally is?” \n \n11.9 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Though such a person reads the shãstras \nthe Purãns, he does not have the refuge of Bhagvãn.  Therefore, his \njeev has been overpowered by inner enemies, such as kãm, krodh, \nlobh, irshyã, and matsar.  These inner enemies never allow him to \neven raise his head.  As a result, the pandits perceive Bhagvãn and His \nsant to be just like themselves.  They think, ‘Just as the inner enemies \nof within us are never eradicated, similarly, the same enemies are \nprobably not eradicated from them either’.  In this way, they perceive \nfaults in Bhagvãn and His sant.  So, even though they read the \nshãstras and Purãns, they fail to realise the greatness of Bhagvãn and \nHis sant as it really is.” \n \n11.10 Next, Shreeji Mahãrãj posed a question to Dinã-Nãth Bhatt and all the \nmunis:  “The sat-purush, who is brahm-svarup, behaves above the \nthree bodies and the three mental states.  Also, he does not believe \nany of the actions of the fourteen indriyas to affect him.  However, an \nignorant person cannot realise this.  Only when he attains a sthiti \nsimilar to that of the sat-purush does he behave like the sat-purush, \nand only then does he understand the great sant’s behaviour.  So, as \nlong as a person has not realised the greatness of the sat-purush, he \ndoes not attain the sthiti of being brahm-svarup.  However, without \nãtmã-nishthã, a person cannot realise the greatness of the sat-purush.  \nTherefore, there seems to be a paradox.  Now, please example how \nthis paradox can be resolved?” \n \n11.11 Everyone attempted to answer to the best of their ability, but no one \nwas able to give a solution to the question. \nVADTÃL \n- 621 - \n11.12 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Here, allow me to answer.  The answer is \nthat when a person develops intense love for a sant who has realised \nthe avatãr of Bhagvãn on this earth, he then never perceives any kind \nof avgun in the sat-purush.  For example, when someone has strong \nlove for someone, he will never see that person’s avgun, and he will \nalways believe the person’s words.  This is natural on the worldly \npath and it is also natural on the path of kalyãn.  Therefore, intense \nlove for the sat-purush is the only means to realising a person’s ãtmã; \nit is the only means to realising the greatness of the sat-purush; and it \nis also the only means to having the direct darshan of Bhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 11 || 211 || \n \n \nVadtãl – 12 \nThe Rise And Fall Of The Jeev \n \n12.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh vad 2 [25th January 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead with \na cylindrical pillow on a wooden platform under the neem tree \noutside the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in Vadtãl.  He was \nwearing a white khes, and had covered Himself with a white \npachhedi, over which He had wrapped a rose-coloured shawl.  He had \ntied a white pãgh around His head and was wearing a garland of \nroses around His neck.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n12.2 In the sabhã, Shreeji Mahãrãj sat thinking for quite some time.  He \nthen opened His eyes and looked compassionately at the sabhã of \nbhaktas, and said, “Today, I wish to talk to all of you about nishchay in \nBhagvãn, so please listen carefully.  Shree Purushottam Bhagvãn, \nwhose svarup is forever divya, is seated in Akshardhãm, which is as \nluminous as countless millions of suns, moons, and flames of fire.  \nThat same Bhagvãn assumes the avatãrs of Rãm and Krishna, upon \nthis earth for the sake of granting kalyãn to the jeevs.  Then, the jeev \nVADTÃL \n- 622 - \nthat develops firm nishchay in that Bhagvãn by great association with \na sant, progresses spiritually day by day, just like the waxing moon \non the second day of the bright half of the lunar month.  As the sun’s \neffect on the moon increases, the waxing moon continues increasing.  \nThen, when Punam finally arrives, the moon becomes full.  Similarly, \nbefore developing total nishchay in Bhagvãn, the jeev is as dim as the \nnew moon of Amãs – only as bright as a glow-worm.  Then, as a \nperson develops nishchay coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvãn’s \ngreatness, his jeevãtmã progresses and becomes like the full moon of \nPunam.  Then, his indriyas and antah-karans are no longer capable of \ndislodging him from his nishchay.  Regardless of the type of charitras \nBhagvãn performs, he does not perceive any fault in Bhagvãn.  In \naddition, a person who has nishchay in Bhagvãn coupled with the \nknowledge of His greatness becomes a brave bhakta. \n \n12.3 “However, if at some time that same bhakta has doubts in the \ncharitras of Bhagvãn, either by the influence of unpleasant kãl, kriyã, \nsang, dhyãn, mantra, dikshã, and shãstra, or due to his identification \nwith the body, then his jeev, which was like a full moon of Punam, \nbecomes like the unlit moon of Amãs.  Therefore, some minor flaw in \na person will not really harm the jeev very much; but, if he somehow \ndoubts the charitras of Bhagvãn, or if he somehow develops a dislike \nfor Bhagvãn, then that jeev instantly falls from the path of kalyãn.  \nJust as when the roots of a tree are cut, the tree automatically \nbecomes dry, similarly, a jeev who perceives avgun in Bhagvãn in any \nway can never stay without falling from the satsang. \n \n12.4 “Moreover, a person whose nishchay in Bhagvãn is weak, despite \nbeing in satsang, still doubts, ‘Who knows whether I will attain kalyãn \nor not?  When I die, will I become a dev?  Or will I become a king?  Or \nwill I become a ghost?’  A person who does not have absolute nishchay \nin Bhagvãn has such doubts.  However, a person who does have \nabsolute nishchay believes, ‘I have attained kalyãn ever since the day I \nattained Bhagvãn.  In fact, whoever has my darshan or listens to my \ntalks will also be freed from all of his sins and will attain Akshardhãm’.  \nVADTÃL \n- 623 - \nSo, maintaining such nishchay coupled with the knowledge of \nBhagvãn’s greatness, a person should believe himself to be fulfilled.  \nAll of you should constantly be aware of this fact.” \n \n12.5 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please sing the following kirtans \ndescribing Bhagvãn’s greatness:  ‘Dhanya Vrundãvan Vãsi Vat-Ni \nChãyã Re Jyã Hari Bestã...’ – glorious are the shades of the banyan trees \nof Vrundãvan, where the lord often sat’.”  Then, the kirtan was sung. \n \n12.6 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “In the same way as the kirtan, Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn has also said in the Shreemad Bhãgvat: \n \naho amee devavarã-marãrchitam pãdãm-bujam te sumanah-falãrhanam \nnaman-tyupãdãya shikhãbhir-ãtmanas-tamo-pahatyai taru-janma yat-krutam \nThese trees – which are worshipped by the chief dev (Indra) and all the other \ndevs – offer fruits and flowers at your holy feet, and bow before you with their \nhands (their branches and leaves) to remove their darkness of ignorance \nwhich caused their birth as trees. \n \n \n“So, even a person who is born as a tree becomes fulfilled by being \nassociated with Bhagvãn.  In fact, even the tree under which Bhagvãn \nhas sat should be understood to be entitled to attain Akshardhãm. \n \n12.7 “A person, who does not have such firm nishchay coupled with the \nknowledge of Bhagvãn’s greatness in his heart, should be known to \nbe impotent – no jeev is ever going to be saved by his words.  For \nexample, a king who is impotent, who is about to lose his kingdom, \nand whose family line is about to end, will still not be able to conceive \na son with his wife.  In fact, even if he summons other impotent men \nlike himself from his entire kingdom and allows them to associate \nwith his wife, she still will not conceive a son.  Similarly, no one \nattains kalyãn by hearing even shãstras like the Geetã and the \nShreemad Bhãgvat from a person who does not have nishchay in \nBhagvãn coupled with the knowledge of His greatness.  Just as death \nis certain for whoever drinks sweetened milk into which a snake’s \nvenom has fallen, similarly, no one can ever attain kalyãn by listening \nVADTÃL \n- 624 - \nto the Geetã or the Shreemad Bhãgvat from a person who does not \nhave nishchay in Bhagvãn coupled with the knowledge of His \ngreatness; only harm can come from it.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 12 || 212 || \n \n \nVadtãl – 13 \nIf Bhagvãn Pervades All, How Can He Possess A Svarup? \n \n13.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh vad 7 [30th January 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a wooden bedstead under \nthe neem tree outside the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in \nVadtãl.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes, and was also \nwearing garlands of white flowers around His neck.  In addition to \nthis, a decorated umbrella with a golden, egg-shaped top-piece had \nbeen placed above Him.  Shreeji Mahãrãj sat in such a charming way, \ntossing a pomegranate in His hand.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n13.2 Then, Bhagu-Bhãi Patidãr of Bhadran approached Shreeji Mahãrãj, \nand asked, “Mahãrãj, how does samãdhi actually occur?” \n \n13.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Bhagvãn assumes an avatãr in Bharat-\nKhand for the kalyãn of jeevs.  When He appears in the svarup of a \nking, he possesses the thirty-nine characteristics of a king; and when \nhe appears in the svarup of a sãdhu, such as Dattãtrey or Kapil-Dev, he \npossesses the thirty characteristics of a sãdhu.  By appearance, \nBhagvãn’s svarup appears similar to that of any human; however, it is \nan exceptionally divya svarup.  For example, a magnetic rock appears \nsimilar to all the other rocks on the earth.  However, there is an \nintrinsic magical property in it.  When a ship sails past a mountain of \nmagnetic rock, all the iron nails of the ship are drawn towards the \nmagnetic rock.  Similarly, when a person does darshan of Bhagvãn’s \nVADTÃL \n- 625 - \nsvarup with shraddhã, be it the svarup of a king or the svarup of a \nsãdhu, his indriyas are drawn towards Bhagvãn.  Then, he attains \nsamãdhi.   \n \n13.4 “Upon having the darshan of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, all the residents \nof Gokul attained samãdhi; and in that samãdhi, Bhagvãn showed \nthem His own dhãm.  In this way, whenever there is an avatãr of \nBhagvãn, then at that time, Bhagvãn’s svarup definitely possesses \ncertain magical powers.  Moreover, all the indriyas of anyone who \ndoes darshan of Bhagvãn with shraddhã are drawn towards Bhagvãn, \nand he instantly enters samãdhi.  At the same time, if Bhagvãn wishes \nto attract many people towards Him, then even people who are not \nbhaktas, and even animals, attain samãdhi upon seeing Him.  So, what \nis so surprising about this happening to a bhakta of Bhagvãn?” \n \n13.5 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “It is generally said that Brahm \npervades everywhere.  But, how can something that is pervasive be \nsaid to possess a svarup?  Also, how can something that possesses a \nsvarup be called pervasive?  That is my question.” \n \n13.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Brahm resides in only one place, but not \neverywhere.  That Brahm is Shree Krishna Bhagvãn; He is in all places \nwhile still residing in only one place.  For example, when a person \nworships Surya, he grants the person a vision like his own.  Then, that \nperson can see as far as Surya’s vision reaches.  Also, a person who \nhas attained siddh-dashã can hear people who may be thousands of \nmillions of miles away as if they are speaking next to him.  In fact, he \nis able to pick up an object that may be millions of miles away, even \nthough his arms are the same size as any other human’s.  Similarly, \nwhen Shree Krishna Bhagvãn wishes to give darshan somewhere, He \ngives His darshan there while still residing in one place.  Even though \nHe has only one svarup, He appears in countless svarups.  In fact, if a \nperson who is a yogi has extraordinary powers such as long-distance \nhearing and long-distance vision, then what is so surprising about \nBhagvãn also possessing such powers? \nVADTÃL \n- 626 - \n13.7 “So, even though the shãstras describe Bhagvãn as pervasive, He \nactually possesses a definite svarup.  In those shãstras, He is \ndescribed as pervasive in the sense that using His own powers, He \ngives His darshan to all while still residing in one place.  But, He is not \npervasive in the sense of being nirãkãr like ãkãsh.  So, in reality, \nBhagvãn eternally possesses a svarup.  It is that Bhagvãn with a \ndefinite svarup, who appears in countless millions of brahmãnds \nwhile always residing in Akshardhãm.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 13 || 213 || \n \n \nVadtãl – 14 \nEven A Sinner Becomes Pure In The Refuge Of A Sat-Purush \n \n14.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh vad 9 [1st February 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in front of the mandir of \nShree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in Vadtãl.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n14.2 Then, Rãm-Chandra Vãghmodiã of Vadodarã asked, “Mahãrãj, why \ndoes a person who seems to be an unworthy person still attain \nsamãdhi?” \n \n14.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Everyone believes that a person who \ndisobeys the dharma of his varna and ãshram as prescribed in the \nshãstras is an ‘unworthy person’.  However, if that unworthy person \nsincerely appreciates the qualities of Bhagvãn and His sant, he earns \ngreat rewards.  As a result, the sins that he had committed by \ndisobeying the dharma of his varna and ãshram are eradicated, and \nhis jeev becomes extremely pure.  Then, when his mind is fixed on \nBhagvãn’s svarup, he attains samãdhi. \nVADTÃL \n- 627 - \n14.4 “Moreover, when a person abides by the dharma of his varna and \nãshram as prescribed in the Dharma-Shãstras, everyone considers \nthat person to be someone who is sincere in his dharma.  However, if \nhe criticises Bhagvãn or His sant, then the result of committing the \nsin of criticising a sat-purush is such that all the rewards earned by \nabiding to the dharma of his varna and ãshram are burnt to ashes.  \nSo, a person who criticises a sat-purush is a worse sinner than a \nperson who has committed the five great sins.  This is because he \nwho has committed one of the five great sins can be redeemed of the \nsin by seeking the refuge of a sat-purush; but there are no means to \nbe redeemed for a person who has criticised a sat-purush.  This is \nbecause when a person goes to a place of pilgrimage, he is freed of \nthe sins he has committed elsewhere; but the sins committed at a \nplace of pilgrimage are totally irredeemable – it is as if they are \netched in iron. \n \n14.5 “Therefore, by seeking the refuge of a sat-purush, regardless of how \nterrible a sinner  a person may be, he becomes extremely pure and \nattains samãdhi.  On the other hand, a person who criticises a sat-\npurush is still a terrible sinner, regardless of how sincere he may \nseem to be in abiding by dharma.  Moreover, he can never have the \ndarshan of Bhagvãn in his heart.  Therefore, whom a vimukh \nconsiders to be a sinner is not a sinner, and whom he considers to be \nsincere in his dharma is not really sincere.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 14 || 214 || \n \n \nVadtãl – 15 \nReligious And Demonic Jeevs \n \n15.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh vad 11 [3rd February 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a platform under the neem \ntree in front of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in Vadtãl.  He \nVADTÃL \n- 628 - \nwas wearing a dagli and a survãl made of kinkhãb.  A rich, orange \nshelu with wide, golden edges had been tied around His head, and \nanother orange shelu with very wide, golden edges rested upon His \nshoulder.  In addition to this, a decorated umbrella with a golden, \negg-shaped top-piece had been placed above Him.  A sabhã of munis, \nas well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n15.2 Then, Shobhã-Rãm Shãstri asked a question:  “Mahãrãj, there are two \ntypes of jeevs:  religious and demonic.  Have they always been like \nthis since eternity, or have they become like this due to association?” \n \n15.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “In the beginning, during the period of \ndestruction, both types of jeevs, religious and demonic, are absorbed \nwithin Mãyã.  Then, when the universe is created, both types of jeevs \nemerge, each with their own nature.  There are also ordinary jeevs \nwho become religious or demonic due to association with religious or \ndemonic jeevs.  Also, there are some religious and demonic jeevs who \ngradually develop such a nature due to the karmas they perform. \n \n15.4 “However, the main cause of such religious and demonic natures is \nthe grace or the fury of a sat-purush.  For example, Jay and Vijay were \npãrshads of Bhagvãn, but since they insulted the religious Sanakãdik, \nthey attained a demonic nature.  On the other hand, Prahlãdji was a \ndemon, but since he absorbed the preaching of Nãradji, he was \nknown as a renowned bhakta of Bhagvãn.  Therefore, whomever the \nfury of a sat-purush falls upon, that jeev becomes demonic; and \nwhomever a sat-purush is pleased upon, that jeev becomes religious.  \nThere is no other reason for becoming religious or demonic.  \nTherefore, a person who desires to attain kalyãn should by no means \ncriticise Bhagvãn or His bhaktas.  Instead, he should do only \nwhatever pleases Bhagvãn and His bhaktas.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 15 || 215 || \n \nVADTÃL \n- 629 - \nVadtãl – 16 \nThe Pleasures Of The Fourteen Loks \n \n16.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh vad 13 [4th February 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a platform under the neem \ntree in front of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in Vadtãl.

He said, \n“Mahãrãj, if you show a miracle to some worldly, renowned man, \nthen its effect will be very beneficial for the development of the \nsatsang.” \n \n16.3 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “I do not get along very well with such \nworldly, renowned men.  After all, they have pride of their power and \nwealth, whereas I have pride of tyãg and bhakti.  Therefore, neither \nof us is in a position to surrender to the other.  Even if I did send \nsome great man into samãdhi, then at most he would give a village or \na part of his kingdom, neither of which I have the slightest desire for \nin my heart.  Even if I were to wish for a village or a part of a kingdom \nfor the sake of happiness, still when I close my eyes and think of \nBhagvãn’s murti; that bliss cannot be found even in a kingdom \nconsisting of the fourteen loks. \n \n16.4 “Also, if there is as much bliss in ruling a kingdom as there is in \nworshipping Bhagvãn, then why would great kings, such as \nSvayambhuv Manu, leave their kingdoms and go into the forests to \nperform tap?  If there is as much bliss in women as there is in \nworshipping Bhagvãn, then why would King Chitraketu abandon ten \nmillion women? \n \n16.5 “Compared to the bliss of worshipping Bhagvãn, the bliss of the \nfourteen loks is said to be like that of Narak.  Therefore, a person \nwhose happiness is based on the bliss of Bhagvãn feels that the \nVADTÃL \n- 630 - \npleasures of all the vishays in the entire brahmãnd are like Narak.  \nEven I feel that the bliss of worshipping Bhagvãn is the only real bliss \n– everything else is full of misery.  Therefore, while worshipping \nBhagvãn, if I encounter someone who is naturally drawn into satsang, \nthen I encourage him; but there is no type of insistence in my heart.  I \nonly insist upon engaging in the worship of Bhagvãn and keeping the \ncompany of bhaktas of Bhagvãn.  What I have disclosed before you is \nmy inner belief.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 16 || 216 || \n \n \nVadtãl – 17 \nThe Sevã Of A Bhakta Is Known As Bhakti \n \n17.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh vad Amãs [6th February 1826], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed in the mansion facing the \nmandir of Shree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in Vadtãl.  He was dressed entirely \nin white clothes.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n17.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked a question:  “Each of the five gnãn-\nindriyas and the five karma-indriyas have total knowledge of their \nrespective vishays.  Furthermore, both a person with gnãn and a \nperson without gnãn behave in the same way through their indriyas; \nthe indriyas of the person with gnãn do not behave in a different way \nfrom those of the person without gnãn.  However, the person with \ngnãn is said to have conquered the indriyas.  How can this be so?  \nThat is the question.” \n \n17.3 Muktãnand Swãmi replied, “It seems that a person conquers his \nindriyas when he attains nirvikalp samãdhi.” \nVADTÃL \n- 631 - \n17.4 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Even a person who has attained nirvikalp \nsamãdhi indulges in the panch vishays through the indriyas just like \neveryone else; so, how can he be said to have conquered his \nindriyas?” \n \n17.5 Muktãnand Swãmi made many attempts to answer the question, but \nhe was unable to give a satisfactory explanation. \n \n17.6 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The answer is that he realises that there \nis only misery in the panch-vishays (shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and \ngandh).  He also realises that there are only kalyãn-kãri qualities in \nthe svarup of Bhagvãn.  He even realises that by indulging in worldly \nvishays, the jeev is condemned to Narak, where he must suffer \nterrible miseries.  Having realised this, he develops an intense hatred \ntowards the panch-vishays.  There is no way a person will have love \ntowards something with which he has such hatred.  A person who \nrealises this, and then develops an extreme hatred in his mind \ntowards the panch-vishays can be said to have conquered his indriyas.  \nAs a result of this, he spends the rest of his life offering bhakti to \nBhagvãn by listening to talks of Bhagvãn, singing kirtans, and \nperforming sevã.  However, unlike a vimukh, he does not become \nattached to the panch-vishays.  Such a person is known to have \nconquered his indriyas.” \n \n17.7 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked another question:  “Suppose there is a \ntyãgi who has adopted the path of nivrutti.  He realises himself to be \nthe ãtmã and does not believe his body to be his true svarup.  Also, \nhis physical behaviour is rather unusual and irregular.  This man \ndoes not have any pride of his varna and ãshram.  The way in which \nhe eats, drinks, rises, and sits is all rather unusual – it does not seem \nto match the norms of society.  Such a tyãgi does not stay in anyone’s \ncompany; he is like a young, carefree deer, wandering alone in a \nforest.  He cannot be bound by anything in any way. \n \nVADTÃL \n- 632 - \n17.8 “On the other hand, there is another tyãgi who behaves in accordance \nwith the path of pravrutti, despite also having adopted the path \nnivrutti.  When he engages in pravrutti that brings out vicious \nnatures, such as kãm, krodh, lobh, moh, mad, matsar, ãshã, and \ntrushnã, it also causes a disturbance in his heart.  So, is it appropriate \nfor such a tyãgi to continue following the path of pravrutti?  If he does \nremain on the path of pravrutti, how could he remain undisturbed?  If \nyou say, ‘If he follows the path of pravrutti by Bhagvãn’s ãgnã then he \nwill not become attached to anything’, then a person can argue, ‘If \nsomeone drinks bhãng by Bhagvãn’s ãgnã, does that mean he will not \nbecome delirious?  Of course, he will become delirious’.  Then, how can \nthat tyãgi follow the path of pravrutti and not become attached to \nanything?  That is the question.” \n \n17.9 Hearing this, Nityãnand Swãmi and Shuk Muni attempted to give an \nexplanation, but were unable to give an accurate reply. \n \n17.10 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The tyãgi who abides by nivrutti dharma \nonly and who behaves in an unusual way should be known as a \nperson who has only ãtmã-nishthã.  On the other hand, the tyãgi who \nhas adopted nivrutti dharma but also offers bhakti to Bhagvãn should \nvigilantly adopt the path of pravrutti related to Bhagvãn and His \nbhaktas while staying within the niyams prescribed by Bhagvãn.  In \nfact, adopting the path of pravrutti in order to serve Bhagvãn and His \nbhaktas is the very definition of bhakti. \n \n17.11 “The tyãgi who has adopted the path of nivrutti and who has only the \nvirtue of ãtmã-nishthã can never be equal to the tyãgi who has \nadopted the path of pravrutti.  This is because although he is also a \ntyãgi who has adopted the path of nivrutti, he engages in pravrutti for \nthe purpose of being able to serve Bhagvãn and His bhaktas.  Such a \nperson should stay on the path of pravrutti while abiding by the \nniyams prescribed by Bhagvãn.  However, he should never do more \nthan or do less than those niyams.  While discarding vicious natures \nVADTÃL \n- 633 - \nsuch as kãm, krodh, lobh, moh, mad, matsar, ãshã, and trushnã, he \nshould follow the path of pravrutti for the purpose of serving \nBhagvãn and His bhaktas.  As a result, he will never become attached \nto anything.  Compared to the tyãgi who has only ãtmã-nishthã, this \ntyãgi is far superior, and it is he who earns the grace of Bhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 17 || 217 || \n \n \nVadtãl – 18 \nFundamental Facts Of The Swãminãrãyan Sampradãy \n \n18.1 In the Samvat year 1882, after the sandhyã ãrti on Mahã sud 1 [7th \nFebruary 1826], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed under the dome of the mandir \nof Shree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in Vadtãl.  He was dressed entirely in \nwhite clothes.  A sabhã of the paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered on all four sides around Him. \n \n18.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Seeing that you are all senior paramhans, \nI shall ask you a question:  Which facts are essential for a satsangi to \nunderstand?  If someone were to ask him, or if he were to experience \na doubt in his own mind, then without knowing these facts, how \nwould he be able to find the solution?” \n \n18.3 Having asked the question, Mahãrãj Himself continued, “I shall \nanswer the question myself.  Firstly, a person should realise that our \nsampradãy is the Uddhav Sampradãy, and therefore, a person should \nknow its customs. \n \n18.4 “Secondly, a person should know the line of succession of our gurus.  \nHe should know that Rãmãnand Swãmi was the avatãr of Uddhav \nhimself; and in a dream, that same Rãmãnand Swãmi was initiated \ninto the Vaishnav sect by Rãmãnuj-Ãchãrya in Shreerang-Kshetra.  So, \nRãmãnand Swãmi’s guru was Rãmãnuj-Ãchãrya, and I am Rãmãnand \nVADTÃL \n- 634 - \nSwãmi’s shishya.  A person should understand the succession of gurus \nin this way.  In addition, he should understand the tradition of the \nDharma-Kul that I have established. \n \n 18.5 “Thirdly, a person should know the authoritative shãstras of our \nsampradãy, the names of which are: Ved, Vyãs Sutra, Shreemad \nBhãgvat Purãn, Vishnu-Sahasranãm from the Mahãbhãrat, Bhagvad \nGeetã, Vidur-Niti, Vãsudev Mahãtmya from the Vishnu-Khand of the \nSkand Purãn, and Yãgnavalkya Smruti.  A person should know these \neight shãstras. \n \n18.6 “Fourthly, a person should know all the niyams which are prescribed \nfor all satsangis. \n \n18.7 “Fifthly, a person should understand Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, our \nishta-dev, and also the variety of the svarup of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn \ndue to varying locations, followers, and actions. \n \n18.8 “In addition, the pratyaksha and the non-pratyaksha svarups of Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn should be understood.  He is non-pratyaksha in the \nsense that Shree Krishna Bhagvãn resides in Akshardhãm in the midst \nof Golok, which is beyond the darkness of Mãyã.  He has two arms and \nis as luminous as millions and millions of suns, while He has a dark \ncomplexion.  Rãdhikãji and Lakshmiji are beside Him, and He is \nserved by pãrshads, such as Nand, Sunand, and Shreedãmã.  He is the \ncause of creation, sustenance, and destruction of countless millions of \nbrahmãnds.  He reigns as the supreme ruler of everything.  This \nBhagvãn sometimes assumes a svarup with four arms; sometimes, He \nassumes a svarup with eight arms; and He may even assume a svarup \nwith a thousand arms.  He also assumes all the svarups of the four \navatãrs (Vãsudev, Sankarshan, Aniruddha, and Pradyumna); as well as \nthe twenty-four avatãrs.  He also takes birth through avatãrs such as \nVarãh, Nrusinh, Vãman, Kapil-Dev, and Hayagriv, while He actually \nalways possesses two arms.  It is this same svarup that has been \ndescribed in the Upanishads, the Sãnkhya shãstras, the Yog shãstras, \nVADTÃL \n- 635 - \nand the Panch-Rãtra.  This is how Bhagvãn’s svarup is described as \nbeing non-pratyaksha. \n \n18.9 “Furthermore, of all the ãchãryas that have lived, Vyãsji is the \ngreatest.  Even Shankar-Ãchãrya cannot be said to be like Vyãsji.  In \nfact, nor can Rãmãnuj-Ãchãrya, nor can Mãdhvã-Ãchãrya, nor can \nNimbãrk, nor can Vishnu Swãmi, and nor can Vallabh-Ãchãrya.  This \nis because those ãchãryas will only be accepted as respected in the \nworld if they accept the greatness of Vyãsji’s words; but not \notherwise.  However, Vyãsji does not need to rely upon anyone else \nto be respected.  This is because Vyãsji is the ãchãrya of the Veds and \nis Himself an avatãr of Bhagvãn.  Therefore, we should abide by \nVyãsji’s teachings only. \n \n18.10 “That same Vyãsji, for the kalyãn of the jeevs, separated the Veds into \nfour parts, wrote the seventeen Purãns, and the Mahãbhãrat.  Still, he \nfelt in his mind, ‘I have not been able to carefully explain the methods \nfor the kalyãn of the jeevs’.  As a result, he did not feel satisfied in his \nmind.  So, he wrote the Shreemad Bhãgvat Purãn, which is the \nessence of all the Veds, the Purãns, the historical shãstras, the Panch-\nRãtra, the Yog shãstras, and the Sãnkhya shãstras.  In that Shreemad \nBhãgvat, He has described Shree Krishna Bhagvãn as greater than all \nthe other avatãrs, and that all the avatãrs originate from that same \nShree Krishna Bhagvãn. \n \n18.11 “In the Gun-Vibhãg chapter of the Shreemad Bhãgvat, Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn says to Uddhav, ‘I am nirgun, and whoever comes into my \ncontact also becomes nirgun’.  That is why all those who came into my \ncontact with Shree Krishna Bhagvãn – with whichever feeling – also \nbecame nirgun, regardless of whether it was a feeling of lust, hatred, \nfear, friendship, or love.  Therefore, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn Himself is \nnirgun.  This is how Vyãsji has described Shree Krishna Bhagvãn.  \nAlso, Vyãsji has established the following principle:  ‘Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn Himself is the Bhagvãn who assumes all the avatãrs, and all \nother avatãrs are also Him’.  If Shree Krishna Bhagvãn is described as \nVADTÃL \n- 636 - \nbeing merely the embodiment of pure sattva-gun instead of being \ndescribed as nirgun, then a person has not grasped the context of the \nShreemad Bhãgvat and it results in a major misunderstanding.  After \nall, the gopis did not realise Shree Krishna Bhagvãn to be Bhagvãn; \ntheir feeling of lust for Shree Krishna Bhagvãn was their method of \nworship of Him.  However, they still became nirgun.  Then, how can \nShree Krishna Bhagvãn be described as being merely the embodiment \nof pure sattva-gun?  Therefore, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn is definitely \nnirgun.  In addition, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn Himself has said to Arjun: \n \njanma karma cha me divyam-evam yo vetti tattvataha \ntyaktvã deham punar-janma naiti mãm-eti sorjuna \nHe who thoroughly realises my birth and actions to be divya will not take \nanother birth when he leaves his body.  Instead, he will attain me. \n \n18.12 “At the time of His birth, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn showed Vãsudev and \nDevki His svarup with four arms so that they would realise Him to be \nBhagvãn.  He also showed Brahmã many svarups with four arms; He \nshowed Akrur the svarup of Shesh-Shãyi Nãrãyan; and He showed \nHimself in the Vishvarup form to Arjun.  In this way, it is acceptable to \nmake distinctions in the types of worship of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn \ndue to differences in His svarups.  However, this true svarup is \ndifferent. \n \n18.13 “In Vraj, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn was known as Bãl-Mukund; He was \nalso called Murli-Manohar, and Rãdhã-Krishna; He used to take the \ncows and calves for grazing; He lifted Mount Govardhan; He played \nrãs with the gopis; He went to Mathurã and killed Kans; He pleased \nthe Yãdavs; He studied at the home of the brãhman named Sãndipani; \nHe associated with Kubjã; He stayed in Dvãrkã, where He married \neight queens, such as Rukmani; He also wedded sixteen thousand \nwomen; while staying in Hastinãpur, He protected the Pãndavs from \nall the calamities which fell upon them; He saved Draupadi from \nhumiliation; and He became Arjun’s charioteer.  In this way, there \nwere many leelãs of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn due to differences in \nlocations.  However, from this, a person should not make distinctions \nVADTÃL \n- 637 - \nin the types of worship of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn’s two-armed svarup.  \nA person who does, should be known as a blasphemer of the guru \nand the guru’s word. \n \n18.14 “In fact, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn has behaved in many different ways.  \nHe has eaten the leftovers of the cow-herds and has even played rãs \nwith the gopis.  However, the bhaktas of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn \nshould not imitate His behaviour.  Instead, they should behave \naccording to the characteristics of a sãdhu and abide by the dharma \nof their varna and ãshram.  They should offer bhakti to Him as \nprescribed by Shree Krishna Bhagvãn in the eleventh skandh of the \nShreemad Bhãgvat, the Bhagvad Geetã, and the Vãsudev Mahãtmya.  \nHowever, they should behave as Shree Krishna Bhagvãn behaved.  A \nperson who does behave as Shree Krishna Bhagvãn behaved is a \nvimukh, and is not my satsangi. \n \n18.15 “Just as a person should not imitate the behaviour of our ishta-dev \nShree Krishna Bhagvãn, similarly, as I am your ãchãrya, your guru, \nand your adviser, you should not imitate my physical behaviour.  \nInstead, all of you should behave according to my ãgnãs that I have \nprescribed for those in my sampradãy; but no one should imitate my \nbehaviour. \n \n18.16 “All paramhans and all satsangis should learn these facts which I have \ntold you.  After understanding them, all should behave accordingly.  \nAlso, when speaking with others, you should tell them to behave \nsimilarly.” \n \n18.17 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj left for dinner.  Upon hearing this \ntalk, all the sãdhus and satsangis understood that the non-pratyaksha \nsvarup of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn whom Shreeji Mahãrãj spoke of is \nnone other than this Shreeji Mahãrãj, son of Bhakti and Dharma, and \nthat no one is greater than Him.  It is only He who is our ishta-dev, \nand it is only He who is our guru. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 18 || 218 || \nVADTÃL \n- 638 - \nVadtãl – 19 \nBecoming A Bhakta Of Bhagvãn \n \n19.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on the evening of Mahã sud 2 [8th February \n1826], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical \npillow that had been placed in the eastern rup-choki of the mandir of \nShree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan in Vadtãl.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n19.2 Then, after the sandhyã ãrti had finished, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, \n“Please listen, I wish to speak to all of you about Bhagvãn.  Whenever \na jeev attains a human body in Bharat-Khand, Bhagvãn’s avatãrs or \nBhagvãn’s sãdhus will certainly also be present on earth at that time.  \nIf that jeev can recognise them, then he becomes a bhakta of Bhagvãn. \n \n19.3 “Once he has become a bhakta of Bhagvãn, it would be improper for \nhim to have love for anything except Bhagvãn.  This is because, \ncompared to the bliss of the dhãm of Bhagvãn, the pleasures of \nworldly vishays are like faeces.  Only worms that live in the faeces feel \nthat there is profound bliss – a human would realise faeces to be \nnothing but utter misery.  Therefore, a person who has recognised \nBhagvãn becomes a pãrshad of Bhagvãn.  Then, he should not cease \nto be an attendant of Bhagvãn by desiring to enjoy the pleasures of \nworldly vishays like worms in faeces. \n \n19.4 “Also, whatever a bhakta of Bhagvãn wishes for comes true.  \nTherefore, he is extremely careless when he desires any object other \nthan Bhagvãn out of ignorance.  That is why a bhakta of Bhagvãn \nshould consider the pleasures and delights of the fourteen loks to be \nlike the faeces of a cow.  He should have strong love only towards \nBhagvãn and His bhakta, by thought, word, and deed.  He should \nbelieve, ‘If a bhakta of Bhagvãn has some desires remaining in him \nother than those of Bhagvãn, he will still attain the status of Indra or \nVADTÃL \n- 639 - \nwill attain Brahm-Lok.  However, unlike worldly people, he will \ncertainly not pass through the cycle of births and deaths or go to \nNarak.  If that is so, then how can a person describe the greatness of \nBhagvãn and the bliss enjoyed by a true bhakta of Bhagvãn?’  \nTherefore, a bhakta of Bhagvãn should maintain deep love only for \nBhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 19 || 219 || \n \n \nVadtãl – 20 \nJanak Rãjã’s Understanding \n \n20.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Mahã sud 3 [10th February 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a square platform under \nthe neem tree in the darbãr of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Nãrãyan \nin Vadtãl.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  Garlands of \nchameli flowers were hanging around His neck.  In addition to this, a \nred umbrella made from fine, silken cloth had been placed above \nHim.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n20.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked the paramhans a question:  “Kãm \nevolves from rajo-gun, and krodh and lobh evolve from tamo-gun.  So, \nwhich one spiritual activity totally uproots the seeds of kãm, krodh, \nand lobh? \n \n20.3 Shuk Muni replied, “The seeds of these vicious natures are burnt \nfrom a person’s heart only when he attains nirvikalp samãdhi and \nwhen he sees the ãtmã.” \n \n20.4 Hearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj raised a doubt:  “Did not Shiv, Brahmã, \nShrungi Rushi, Parãshar, and Nãrad have nirvikalp samãdhi?  All were \novercome by kãm.  However, despite their attainment of nirvikalp \nVADTÃL \n- 640 - \nsamãdhi, when the vruttis of their indriyas reverted outwards, they \nwere overcome by the vicious natures, like kãm, and krodh.  For this \nreason, what you have said cannot be the answer to the question.  In \nfact, just as a person with gnãn remains undisturbed in nirvikalp \nsamãdhi, a person without gnãn also remains undisturbed in \nsushupti.  When the vruttis of the indriyas revert outwards, both are \ndisturbed by kãm and krodh.  Therefore, there does not seem to be \nany distinction between the person with gnãn and the person \nwithout gnãn.  Now, other paramhans may try to answer the \nquestion.” \n \n20.5 Then, Gopãlãnand Swãmi, Devãnand Swãmi, Nityãnand Swãmi, and \nMuktãnand Swãmi collectively attempted to answer the question \naccording to their understanding, but they could not give a precise \nresponse to Shreeji Mahãrãj’s question. \n \n20.6 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Janak Rãjã followed the path of pravrutti, \nand yet he was undisturbed.  For example, when a female tyãgi \nnamed Sulbhã came into Janak Raja’s court, He told Sulbhã, ‘Though \nyou are trying to seduce my mind, by the grace of my guru Panch-Shikh \nRushi, I have mastered the shãstras of both Sãnkhya and Yog.  So, even \nif half of my body is smeared with sandalwood paste and the other half \nis slashed with a sword, both would be the same to me.  Even if my \nMithilã were to burn down, still nothing of mine would be burned.  \nTherefore, even though I have adopted the path of pravrutti, I am still \nunaffected and undisturbed’.  This is what Janak Rãjã said to Sulbhã.  \nAlso, Janak Rãjã was said to be the guru of Shukji. \n \n20.7 “Therefore, the answer to the question is as follows:  A person’s \nindriyas may be directed outwards and he may be on the path of \npravrutti, but if he has a firm understanding in his heart, like that of \nJanak Rãjã , then he will in no way become disturbed by vicious \nnatures, like kãm, and krodh. \n \nVADTÃL \n- 641 - \n20.8 “After a person has thoroughly known that which needs to be known \n– this is true and this is false – he realises that except Bhagvãn’s \nsvarup, all worldly objects are full of terrible miseries, and that they \nare all perishable.  Also, he realises himself to be the ãtmã, distinct \nfrom his body, his indriyas, and his antah-karans.  After this, there is \nno object that would be strong enough to seduce him.  This is because \nhe sees all worldly objects as worthless.  So, even if all the indriyas of \na person in whose heart such understanding has become firmly \nrooted were to extend outwards on the path of pravrutti, still he \nwould not be disturbed by vicious natures, like kãm, and krodh. \n \n20.9 “The seeds of vicious natures, like kãm, and krodh, in the heart of \nsuch a bhakta of Bhagvãn will be destroyed, whether he is a tyãgi or a \ngrahastha.  Also, of all the bhaktas of Bhagvãn, he is the best \nVaishnavs.  So, being a tyãgi or a grahastha is of no significance.  \nInstead, a person whose understanding is greater should be known \nas being a greater bhakta than the rest. \n \n20.10 “The mistake of those like Shiv and Brahmã were mentioned only to \nillustrate that when they encountered unpleasant desh, kãl, kriyã, and \nsang, even they were disturbed by vicious natures, regardless of \nwhether they had deficiencies in their understanding or not.  \nTherefore, even if a person has this understanding, he should never \nassociate with any type of evil influence.  This is the universal \nprinciple.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Vadtãl || 20 || 220 || \n \n \n|| End of Shree Vadtãl Prakaran ||\nAMDÃVÃD \n- 642 - \n|| SHREE SWÃMINÃRAYAN VIJAYTETRÃM || \n \nVACHANÃMRUT \nShree Amdãvãd Prakaran \n \nAmdãvãd – 1 \nExtraordinary Dhyãn \n \n1.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Mahã vad 11 [4th March 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting facing west in the mandir of \nShree Nar-Nãrãyan in Amdãvãd.

Then, while performing dhyãn in this way, the sun and the moon \nbegin to appear in the eyes exactly as they are in the sky.  As a result, \nthe right eye begins to heat up, and the left eye begins to cool down.  \nThen, the sun should be envisioned in the left eye and the moon in \nthe right eye.  After visualising in this way, the sun, and the moon \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 643 - \nshould be visualised within the hruday-ãkãsh.  In addition, the svarup \nof his own jeev, the observer, should also be seen.  He should also \nperform dhyãn upon Bhagvãn – who resides within the observer \n(within his own jeev).  At that point, his body, which is full of worldly \ndesires, is felt to rotate in the sky like a pulley mechanism used for \ndrawing water from a well. \n \n1.4 \n“Eventually, a person who performs dhyãn in this way attains the \ndarshan of Bhagvãn’s Vishvarup form, within which he also sees the \nsystem of the fourteen loks.  That svarup is not seen as being \nextremely large; it is seen in the same way that Mãrkandey Rushi saw \nthe entire brahmãnd in the stomach of the child svarup of Bhagvãn \nsleeping on the leaf of a banyan tree. \n \n1.5 \n“Having performed dhyãn in this way, a person is able to see \neverything that is described in the shãstras.  Then, all remaining \nnãstik feelings within his jeevãtmã are resolved, and the jeev becomes \nextremely powerful.  In addition, he develops a firm belief that \nwhatever is stated in the shãstras is true.  The eight extraordinary \npowers become accessible to a person who performs this dhyãn, and \nhis vision reaches as far as the rays of the sun and moon.  In this way, \ncountless extraordinary powers appear before that person, but \nbecause he is a bhakta of Bhagvãn, he does not accept any of those \npowers.  Instead, he performs dhyãn only on Bhagvãn.  As a result, \nthe performer of this dhyãn attains siddh-dashã like Nãrad, the \nSanakãdik, and Shukji.  Therefore, there are countless varieties of \ndhyãn, but only this form of dhyãn grants instant siddh-dashã.” \n \n1.6 \nAfter Shreeji Mahãrãj concluded this description, Muktãnand Swãmi \nasked, “Is this dhyãn attained only by a person who practices the \nprãnãyãm of ashtãng-yog, or can it be attained by others as well?” \n \n1.7 \nShreeji Mahãrãj explained, “It does not matter whether a person \npractices prãnãyãm or not.  Only if he practices this dhyãn and is an \nekãntik bhakta of Bhagvãn can he perfect it.  However, people are \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 644 - \nunable to walk this path.  Therefore, for those who are eligible to \nperform this dhyãn, there is no alternative method for instantly \nbecoming siddh other than the method of dhyãn that I have just \ndescribed.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Amdãvãd || 1 || 221 || \n \n \nAmdãvãd – 2 \nPerforming Pujã After Washing And Bathing \nThe Best Bhakta Abandons Worldly Responsibilities \n \n2.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Fãgan sud 11 [20th March 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a wooden bedstead on a \nsquare platform in front of the mandir of Shree Nar-Nãrãyan in \nAmdãvãd.  He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself \nwith a white chofãl.  He had also tied a pink feto around His head, \nwith tassels of roses dangling from it.  Also, two bunches of roses \nadorned His neck.  In addition to this, bãjubandh and gajarã of roses \nhad been tied around His arms.  In this way, His entire body had been \ndecorated with roses.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n2.2 \nThen, addressing all the paramhans, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “I would \nlike to ask you a question.  Suppose there is a bhakta of Bhagvãn who \nbehaves above the influence of jãgrat, svapna, and sushupti.  He has \nshed the influence of polluted rajo-gun, tamo-gun, and sattva-gun, \nand acts within pure sattva-gun.  That is how he worships Bhagvãn.  \nAnother bhakta behaves under the influence of the three gun but he \ndoes have intense love for Bhagvãn.  Of these two bhaktas, who is \nbetter?” \n \n2.3 \nThen, the sãdhus replied, “The bhakta with love for Bhagvãn is \nbetter.” \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 645 - \n2.4 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then questioned, “Now, consider the following:  One \nperson performs pujã of Bhagvãn after washing, bathing, and \nbecoming pure; and another performs pujã in an impure state.  Of \nthese two, who is better?” \n \n2.5 \nThe munis replied, “The person who performs pujã after becoming \npure is better.” \n \n2.6 \nHearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “You claim that the person who \nworships Bhagvãn after overcoming mãyik influences is inferior, and \nthe person who expresses love for Bhagvãn with mãyik influences is \nsuperior.  But, how is he superior?” \n \n2.7 \nSince no one could answer the question, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Of the \nfour types of bhaktas (ãrta, jignãsu, arthãrthi, and gnãni) described in \nthe Geetã, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn had called the only bhaktas \npossessing gnãn His own ãtmã.  Therefore, the person who becomes \nbrahm-rup after having discarded mãyik influences, and then \nworships Bhagvãn, is the best bhakta. \n \n2.8 \n“This is because nitya-pralay is the jeev’s sushupti state.  Nimit-pralay \nis Brahmã’s sushupti state.  Prãkrut-pralay is when all the entities that \nhave evolved from Prakruti merge back into Prakruti.  In ãtyantik-\npralay, which is gnãn-pralay, everything up to and including Prakruti \nis hidden by the light of Brahm.  Furthermore, in nitya-pralay, all of \nthe jeev’s responsibilities are absorbed; and in prãkrut-pralay, all of \nPurush’s responsibilities are absorbed.  However, when the creation \nprocess is initiated, all three are again engulfed by their respective \nresponsibilities. \n \n2.9 \n“However, a person who has overcome mãyik influences by way of \nãtyantik-pralay, also called gnãn-pralay, is never engulfed by those \nresponsibilities again.  If at any time he does assume a physical body, \nthen just like Bhagvãn assumes a body by His own will, he also \nassumes a body of his own will; he does not assume a body due to \nKãl, karma, or Mãyã. \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 646 - \n2.10 “Therefore, the person who worships Bhagvãn after becoming \nbrahm-rup is definitely superior.  Only a person who is a faithful \nbhakta of Bhagvãn and possesses the characteristics of an ekãntik \nbhakta can understand this fact.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Amdãvãd || 2 || 222 || \n \n \nAmdãvãd – 3 \nThe Branch Of A Banyan Tree \nThe Upsham State \n \n \n \n3.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Fãgan vad 2 [25th March 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that \nhad been placed on the platform facing the mandir of Shree Nar-\nNãrãyan in Amdãvãd.  A pink pãgh, decorated with garlands of roses \nand chameli flowers, adorned His head.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n3.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked the entire muni-mandal, “All jeevs are \ndependent upon the panch-vishays.  Either they physically indulge in \nthem, or if physical association is not possible, they think of them \nwithin the antah-karans – but the jeev is unable to remain for even a \nmoment without thinking about or indulging in the panch-vishays. \n \n3.3 \n“Now, take the example of a banyan tree.  Everyone knows that the \nroots of a banyan tree keep the tree green.  Even if all of its roots, \nexcept for a few minor roots, are uprooted, the banyan tree will still \nremain green.  In the same way, a person may have outwardly \nabandoned the panch-vishays, but if thoughts of them still remain, \nthen those thoughts become a cause of births and deaths.  The \nquestion is how can these panch-vishays not become a cause of births \nand deaths for a bhakta of Bhagvãn?” \n \n3.4 \nMuktãnand Swãmi attempted to answer the question, but was unable \nto offer a satisfactory reply. \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 647 - \n3.5 \nSo, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Here, I shall answer the question.  When a \nbhakta thinks about the murti of Bhagvãn while behaving as the ãtmã \n– independent of the qualities of the three bodies, which are engulfed \nin mãyã – then by the power of those thoughts of Bhagvãn, he \nbehaves in a state of upsham.  Then, due to the power of that upsham, \nthe panch-vishays do not become a cause of births and deaths. \n \n3.6 \n“Consider the following analogy:  When rivers like the Mahi or the \nSãbarmati are in full flow between their two banks, even elephants, \nhorses, and trees are all carried away; nothing is able to remain \nstationary.  Similarly, for a person in the upsham state, regardless of \nhow attractive the objects presented before the indriyas are, when he \nfocuses his attention within, they are forgotten, just as those vishays \nseen in past lives are forgotten in this life.  Such behaviour of a \nbhakta is known as upsham. \n \n3.7 \n“Such upsham is indeed extremely important.  Suppose an ignorant \nman and woman, who are engaged in worldly life and who have \nintense love for each other before marriage, are then married and \nmade to stay awake and walk continuously for three days and nights.  \nThen, when they are united, due to their fatigue, they will be \nincapable of enjoying the pleasure of each other’s beauty or touch.  \nEven if they embrace each other, they would sleep like logs tied \ntogether, but would not experience any enjoyment from the panch-\nvishays.  So, if they have no awareness of the vishays due to upsham \nattained ignorance during sushupti, then how can the panch-vishays \nbind a person with siddh-dashã who attains the state of upsham by \nperforming dhyãn upon Bhagvãn’s murti?  They certainly do not bind \nhim.  Therefore, the panch-vishays are not a cause of births and \ndeaths for a person who has attained upsham.” \n \n3.8 \nThen, Nityãnand Swãmi commented, “The method you have \ndescribed for attaining the state of upsham (performing dhyãn upon \nBhagvãn after ãtmã-nishthã) is very difficult.  Please tell us if there is \nanother, easier method apart from that.” \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 648 - \n3.9 \nShreeji Mahãrãj said, “A bhakta of Bhagvãn who deeply understands \nthe greatness of Bhagvãn, and performs darshan of Bhagvãn, and \nserves Him and His bhaktas with extremely intense shraddhã, attains \nthat upsham state. \n \n3.10 “However, it appears to me that a servant with mãn will not be liked \nby anyone.  To have a servant with mãn serve a person is like when \neven the rich survive by eating kodrã during a famine; having a \nservant with mãn to serve a person is similar to this.  The master is \nnot as pleased with a servant with mãn as much as he is with a \nhumble servant.  Therefore, a person who does whatever pleases the \nmaster is a true servant.” \n \n3.11 Shuk Muni then asked, “How can a person without wisdom and \nunderstanding please his master?” \n \n3.12 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Even though Mulji Brahm-Chãri and Ratanji \nare not extremely intelligent, they have an intense yearning for \nkalyãn.  So, they do indeed know how to do whatever pleases \nBhagvãn. \n \n3.13 “Also, currently, even the paramhans and the sãnkhya-yogi and \nkarma-yogi satsangis do not behave in a way that pleases me, like the \nbhaktas of Ayodhyã men and women.  This is because the bhaktas of \nAyodhyã have totally dedicated their lives for satsang.  Therefore, \nnobody knows how to please Bhagvãn like the bhaktas of Ayodhyã.  \nMoreover, these bhaktas of Ayodhyã are extremely trusting; a \ncunning person can cheat them.  Therefore, if they wish to begin any \nactivity, they should be allowed to do so only after consulting the \nsenior paramhans and senior satsangi grahasthas.  However, they \nshould not be allowed to do that activity based on the word of a \nsingle person.  In this way, the tyãgis and grahastha satsangis should \nlook after the bhaktas of Ayodhyã.  This is my ãgnã.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Amdãvãd || 3 || 223 || \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 649 - \nAmdãvãd – 4 \nThe Avatãr Of Bhagvãn  \n \n4.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Fãgan vad 3 [26th March 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \ncylindrical pillow placed on a decorated bedstead upon a square \nplatform facing the mandir of Shree Nar-Nãrãyan in Amdãvãd.  He \nwas dressed entirely in white clothes.  A pink pãgh had been tied \naround His head, and tassels of roses were dangling from that pãgh.  \nBunches of roses had also been placed upon His ears.  In addition to \nthis, several garlands of roses were hanging around His neck, and \nbãjubandh and gajarã of roses had been tied around His arms.  A \nsabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \n4.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said to the muni-mandal and the bhaktas, \n“Everyone, please listen to what I have to say.  A person should first \ndevelop a firm belief of the svarup of Bhagvãn.  What is Bhagvãn like?  \nWell, by His own wish, He takes birth for the kalyãn of the jeevs.  \nHowever, having taken birth, He is still beyond birth.  Despite having \nto die, Bhagvãn is still beyond ageing and death.  He is also niranjan, \nand He has no blemish of Mãyã.  In addition, He possesses a definite \nmurti and is svayam-prakãsh; He is Parbrahm, antaryãmi, the \nsupporter of countless millions of brahmãnds; and He is also beyond \nAkshar.  His assuming and discarding of a human body is merely an \nillusion – like the magic of a magician.  Furthermore, He is the \ncontroller of the countless muktas, including Akshar.  He is also the \nlord of all.  That Shree Purushottam Nãrãyan, after first taking birth \nfrom Dharma-Dev and Murti, performs tap in Badrikãshram in the \nsvarup of Nar-Nãrãyan. \n \n4.3 \n“That same Shree Nar-Nãrãyan assumes the svarup of Matsya, Kurma, \nVarãh, Vãman, Rãm, and Krishna on the earth for the fulfilment of \nparticular tasks.  Then, using His own body, He helps other people \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 650 - \neradicate their belief of being the body and accept the belief of being \nthe svarup of brahm.  In this way, He makes His body and the bodies \nof other people appear to be the same.  For example, just as after a \nthorn is used to remove another thorn, both thorns are discarded, \nsimilarly, Bhagvãn discards His body like other jeevs discard theirs.  \nThis event is explained in the Mahãbhãrat through the story of \nNrusinhji.  When He wished to leave His body, Nrusinhji, through His \nantaryãmi powers, inspired Shiv within his heart to take the svarup of \na sharabh.  Then, both Nrusinhji and the sharabh fought a battle in \nwhich Nrusinhji died.  Therefore, Bhagvãn independently, by His own \nwish, accepts a human body and abandons that human body. \n \n4.4 \n“After hearing the charitras of Rushabh-Dev being burnt in a forest \nfire, and Shree Krishna Bhagvãn being killed by an arrow striking his \nfoot, the minds of those with a nãstik belief, and those who are not \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn become confused.  They then allege that Bhagvãn \ntoo passes through birth and death just like themselves, and He \nreceives a human body according to His karmas, and then leaves the \nhuman body by His karmas as well.  They also declare that only when \nBhagvãn performs karmas that do not cause attachment will He be \nreleased of His karmas and attain kalyãn. \n \n4.5 \n“On the other hand, those who have an ãstik mind, and those who are \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn, realise the understanding of the nãstiks to be \nwrong.  They know the body of Bhagvãn to be eternal; and that the \nbirth, childhood, youth, old age, and death of Bhagvãn, as well as \nwhatever other bodily qualities He may display, are merely an \nillusion.  This is because Kãl and Mãyã are not powerful enough to \nhave any sort of influence on Bhagvãn’s body.  In fact, all changes that \ndo appear to occur in Bhagvãn’s body are all due to His extraordinary \npowers.  Those who are bhaktas of Bhagvãn are not misled by this; \nwhereas the minds of those who are not bhaktas become confused, \njust like worldly people become confused on seeing a magician’s acts.  \nHowever, those who are aware of the magician’s techniques are not \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 651 - \nconfused.  Similarly, Purushottam Shree Nar-Nãrãyan also assumes \nmany different bodies and discards them like the magician.  \nTherefore, this Shree Nar-Nãrãyan is the cause of all avatãrs. \n \n4.6 \n“Those who assume death upon Shree Nar-Nãrãyan will themselves \nhave to undergo countless births.  The suffering of passing through \nthe cycle of 8.4 million different life-forms and the torments of \nYampuri are indeed endless.  Conversely, those who realise Shree \nNar-Nãrãyan to be beyond ageing and death will be released from \ntheir karmas and the consequent cycle of births and deaths in the 8.4 \nmillion life-forms.  Therefore, all satsangis and sãdhus of our Uddhav \nSampradãy should not assume death upon the murtis of Bhagvãn – \nthose that have occurred in the past, the current murti, or those that \nwill occur in the future.  This principle should be noted by all.” \n \n4.7 \nIn this way, Shreeji Mahãrãj revealed Himself as the pratyaksha murti \nof Bhagvãn.  All who heard this talk strengthened their nishchay in \nShreeji Mahãrãj in this same way. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Amdãvãd || 4 || 224 || \n \n \nAmdãvãd – 5 \nDharma, Arth, Kãm, And Moksh \n \n5.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Fãgan vad 4 [27th March 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \ncylindrical pillow placed on a decorated bedstead on top of a square \nplatform north of the mandir of Shree Nar-Nãrãyan in Amdãvãd.  He \nwas dressed entirely in white clothes.  Around His neck was a large \ngarland of roses, and tassels of flowers were hanging from His pãgh.  \nWith His right hand, He was turning a mãlã made from tulsi beads.  A \nsabhã of senior munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 652 - \n5.2 \nThen, Chhadidãr Kuber Sinh asked, “Mahãrãj, what is the most \nextraordinary characteristic of Shree Purushottam Nãrãyan?” \n \n5.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “No one except Shree Purushottam Nãrãyan \ncan control the nãdis and prãns of innumerable beings and grant \nthem instant samãdhi; nor can anyone else influence hundreds of \nthousands of people by having them abide by niyams; and nor does \nanyone else have the power to control Akshar and the muktas.  These \nare the extraordinary characteristics of Purushottam Nãrãyan.” \n \n5.4 \nThen, Kuber Sinh asked a second question:  “Mahãrãj, there are \ncountless millions of brahmãnds.  In this brahmãnd, the avatãr of \nBhagvãn is present in Bharat-Khand, in Jambu-Dvip.  But, please \nexplain how Bhagvãn gives kalyãn to the countless beings of the \nother brahmãnds.” \n \n5.5 \nShreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The very Bhagvãn that resides in this \nbrahmãnd is also the lord of all.  It is Bhagvãn who assumes a body in \neach brahmãnd for the sake of the kalyãn of countless beings.  These \nbeings seek His refuge and consequently attain the holy feet of Shree \nPurushottam Nãrãyan in Akshardhãm.  That is the answer to your \nquestion.” \n \n5.6 \nKuber Sinh then asked again, “Mahãrãj, what please identify what \nsatsangis should abandon and what they should accept.” \n \n5.7 \nShreeji Mahãrãj answered, “They should abandon all desires for \nworldly objects.  Instead, they should develop desires related to \nBhagvãn.  If they do have desires for wealth, they should think, ‘If we \nworship Bhagvãn, we will attain gold coins, diamonds, rubies, jewels, \nand other invaluable things in the dhãm of Bhagvãn’.  However, in no \nway should they have desires for worldly objects.  If they have lustful \ndesires, they should think, ‘If we look lustfully towards another \nwoman, we will have to pass through the cycle of 8.4 million life-forms \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 653 - \nand suffer extensively.  Even dogs and donkeys indulge in this, whereas \nI have attained the pratyaksha svarup form of Purushottam.  It will be \na great loss for me if He is displeased’.  After thinking in this way, they \nshould abandon such lustful desires and should desire happiness that \nis related to Bhagvãn.  If they have love for the relatives of the body, \nthey should also abandon it.  Instead, they should develop love \ntowards the Bhagvãn’s sant.  They should accept this much. \n \n5.8 \n“On the other hand, satsangis should abandon the sense of ‘I-ness’ \ntowards the body and develop an attitude of a dãs towards Bhagvãn.  \nIf Bhagvãn or His sant have become displeased in any way or have \ndisapproved of a person, then he should discard all cruel feelings that \nhe may have developed towards Bhagvãn or His sant.  Moreover, he \nshould realise his own mistake and accept the gun of Bhagvãn and \nHis sant.  In this way, a person should always think positively, but \nnever think negatively.  That is the answer to your question.” \n \n5.9 \nThen, Kuber Sinh asked another question:  “Mahãrãj, please explain \nthe nature of dharma, arth, kãm, and moksh.” \n \n5.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj smiled gently and said, “The nature of arth is to \naccumulate wealth or to fulfil a person’s aim of moksh.  That is the \nnature of arth.  The nature of dharma is to use that wealth in satsang \nfor the purpose of dharma; but, not spend it for other purposes.  That \nis the nature of dharma.  The nature of kãm is to have only one wife, \nto have physical relations with her only at the appropriate time, to \nreject all women in the world by regarding them as a mother, sister, \nor daughter.  That is the nature of kãm.  Finally, the nature of moksh \nis to attentively follow all the niyams of satsang and keep unfaltering \nnishchay in Bhagvãn.  That is the nature of moksh.  That is the answer \nto your question.” \n \n5.11 Shreeji Mahãrãj then retired to sleep. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Amdãvãd || 5 || 225 || \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 654 - \nAmdãvãd – 6 \nThe Cause Of All Avatãrs \n \n6.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Fãgan vad 6 [29th March 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on \ntop of a square platform facing the mandir of Shree Nar-Nãrãyan in \nAmdãvãd.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  Garlands of \nroses were placed around His neck, and tassels of chameli flowers \nwere hanging from both sides of His pãgh.  Bunches of roses had \nbeen placed upon both of His ears.  In addition to this, Shreeji \nMahãrãj had taken a large bunch of roses in His hand and was gently \nrubbing it around His face.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n6.2 \nThen, after the evening ãrti, Kuber Sinh asked Shreeji Mahãrãj a \nquestion:  “Mahãrãj, please reveal how nishchay in Bhagvãn that a \nperson has firmly established in his heart would never falter.” \n \n6.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj first commented, “Everyone should hear the answer \nto this question, so please listen attentively.”  He then said, “If a \nperson knows the greatness of the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvãn, \nthen his belief never falters.  I shall now explain that greatness. \n \n6.4 \n“All the avatãrs of Bhagvãn emerge from the very Bhagvãn that is \npresent in this satsang.  He is the cause of all the avatãrs and is the \nantaryãmi of all.  It is Bhagvãn in Akshardhãm, who is radiant, full of \ncountless powers, and eternally has a svarup.  He is also the lord of all \nthe lords of the countless brahmãnds; He is even the cause of Akshar-\nBrahm.  When that Bhagvãn takes birth on earth and adopts the \nbehaviour of Rushabh-Dev, He is known as Rushabh-Dev; when He \naccepts the divine ways of the avatãr of Rãm, He is known as Rãm-\nChandra; and when He performs the charitras of Shree Krishna, He is \nknown as Shree Krishna.  In this way, whichever behaviour of the \navatãrs can be seen in Bhagvãn, it should be understood that all the \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 655 - \nprevious avatãrs of Bhagvãn have emerged from Him, and that He is \nthe ultimate cause of them all.  If a person understands this, his belief \nnever falters.  But, if he does not understand this, his belief may \nfalter.  That is the answer to your question.” \n \n6.5 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then added, “Furthermore, that same Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn took birth as Shree Nar-Nãrãyan from Dharma and Bhakti.  \nTherefore, realising this Shree Nar-Nãrãyan to be my svarup, I have \ninstalled His murti for the first time here in Shree-Nagar.  Therefore, \nno one should perceive even the slightest difference between Shree \nNar-Nãrãyan and myself.  It is He who is the dweller of Akshardhãm.” \n \n6.6 \nHearing Shreeji Mahãrãj say this, Kuber-Sinh asked further, “Mahãrãj, \nwhat is that Akshardhãm like?  Please describe it and the bhaktas of \nBhagvãn that reside there.” \n \n6.7 \nShreeji Mahãrãj explained, “It is Akshardhãm which has become the \ndhãm of Shree Purushottam Nãrãyan to dwell in.  That Akshardhãm in \nthe svarup of the dhãm of Bhagvãn is eternal in comparison to all the \nother Akshardhãms (the muktas who have become like Akshar-\nBrahm).  Within that Akshardhãm, there are several types of palaces.  \nEach palace has various types of decorative balconies and terraces.  \nThere are also many different types of fountains and many different \ntypes of gardens.  The gardens contain innumerable flowers of \ninnumerable species, and each one is radiant.  It is so beautiful that it \ncannot be compared to any other dhãm.  It is also called Golok.  In \naddition, its splendour is countless times more than the divine riches \nof countless other dhãms. \n \n6.8 \n“That dhãm is also limitless.  Just as there is no limit to ãkãsh, \nregardless of the direction in which a person looks, similarly, there is \nno limit to Akshardhãm.  Whether a person looks above, below, or in \nthe four directions, there is no boundary to the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  \nThis is because it is endless.  If a person were to try to reach its end, \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 656 - \nhe would realise that it is endless.  Such is the vastness of \nAkshardhãm. \n \n6.9 \n“Also, the objects within Akshardhãm are all divya and composed of \nchaitanya.  Countless pãrshads, who are also radiant and have a divya \nsvarup, reside in that dhãm.  They are forever eager for the sevã of \nBhagvãn, who is the antaryãmi of all life-forms.  It is the same lord of \nthat dhãm – the lord of Akshar and the muktas, Parbrahm \nPurushottam – who is present here in this satsang.  Only a person \nwho has such nishchay attains Akshardhãm.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Amdãvãd || 6 || 226 || \n \n \nAmdãvãd – 7 \nDivine Characteristics Of Shreeji Mahãrãj \n \n7.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Fãgan vad 7 [30th March 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was having the Vãsudev Mahãtmya read \non the medi above the gate of the mandir of Shree Nar-Nãrãyan in \nAmdãvãd.  Then, in the evening, He got up and sat facing east on a \ndecorated bedstead under the neem tree near the gate.  Around His \nhead, He had tied a pink pãgh, and tassels of roses had been inserted \ninto the pãgh.  He was also wearing garlands of roses.  In addition to \nthis, He was wearing a white survãl and had covered Himself with a \nthin, white chofãl.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n7.2 \nThen, Prãgji Davé asked, “Mahãrãj, by what means can a person’s \nmind become firmly fixed on you so that it does not become \nadulterous by straying elsewhere?” \n \n7.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj began by saying, “Please listen as I answer your \nquestion.”  He then continued, “By realising the greatness of Bhagvãn, \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 657 - \na person’s mind becomes fixed on Him.  Now, I shall explain how that \ngreatness should be understood. \n \n7.4 \n“I had previously asked Rãmãnand Swãmi at Lãdhã Brãhman’s house \nin Piplãnã, ‘Are you truly Bhagvãn, or are you merely called Bhagvãn?’  \nRãmãnand Swãmi did not reply then.  Later, in Samvat 1869, I had \nfallen ill.  During my illness, I went to Kshir-Sãgar where Shesh-Shãyi \nNãrãyan rests upon Shesh, and I saw Rãmãnand Swãmi there.  He was \nwearing a white dhoti and had covered himself with a white \npachhedi.  I also saw many others sitting near the holy feet of Shesh-\nShãyi Nãrãyan.  I asked Nãrãyan, ‘Who is this Rãmãnand Swãmi?’  \nNãrãyan replied, ‘He is a knower of Brahm’.  After He said this, \nRãmãnand Swãmi merged into the body of Nãrãyan, and I then \nreturned to my physical body. \n \n7.5 \n“Then, when I performed antar-drashti, I saw the source of the divine \nsound of pranav.  While I was looking at it, Nandishvar, the bull, \napproached me.  I mounted upon it and went to Shiv in Kailãs.  There, \nGarud arrived.  So, I mounted upon it and began to travel to Vaikunth \nand Akshardhãm.  However, as Garud was unable to fly to \nAkshardhãm, I went alone to the dhãm of Shree Purushottam \nNãrãyan, which is beyond everything.  There, I saw that it was I who \nwas Purushottam; I did not see anyone important, apart from myself.  \nIn this way, I travelled to these places, and then finally returned to \nmy body. \n \n7.6 \n“Then, when I looked within again, I realised that I am the creator, \nsustainer, and destroyer of all the brahmãnds.  In those countless \nbrahmãnds, it is by my divine light that countless Shivs, countless \nBrahmãs, countless Kailãs, countless Vaikunths, Golok, Akshardhãm, \nas well as countless millions of other loks, are radiant. \n \n7.7 \n“What am I like?  Well, if I were to shake the earth with the toe of my \nfoot, the worlds of countless brahmãnds would begin to shake.  It is \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 658 - \nalso by my divine light that the sun, the moon, and the stars are \nradiant.  So, if a person develops the belief of my svarup in this way, \nhis mind becomes fixed on me – Bhagvãn – and would never stray \nanywhere else.  Moreover, I will grant my supreme dhãm to all who \ncome to my refuge and understand this.  In addition, I will make them \nantaryãmi, and powerful enough to create, sustain, and destroy \nbrahmãnds.  However, after receiving such powers, a person should \nnot think, ‘I alone my great’, and neglect and murti of Shree Nar-\nNãrãyan.  Instead, a person should realise ‘It is by compassion of Shree \nNar-Nãrãyan that I have attained such greatness’.” \n \n7.8 \nIn this way, Shreeji Mahãrãj answered the question. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Amdãvãd || 7 || 227 || \n \n \nAmdãvãd – 8 \nThe Prãyshchit For Anger  \n \n8.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Fãgan vad 8 [31st March 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was serving food to the sãdhus in their \nresidential hall, north of the mandir of Shree Nar-Nãrãyan in \nAmdãvãd.  He had tied a beautiful, white pãgh around His head and \nwas wearing a white khes.  He has also placed a khes over His left \nshoulder and had tied one of its ends around His waist.  Also, a large \ngarland of roses was hanging around His neck. \n \n8.2 \nWhile serving lãdus to the sãdhus, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A sãdhu \nshould abandon anger in all respects.  What is anger like?  Well, it \ndestroys all noble qualities such as gnãn, the performance of tap, and \nthe chanting of the name of Bhagvãn. \n \n8.3 \n“Now, I shall identify the motives from which anger arises.  Anger \narises when sãdhus are engaged in a question-answer discussion \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 659 - \namongst themselves, or if there is an argumentative discussion.  It \ncan also arise from the giving and taking of particular objects, or \nwhen lecturing someone, or when a person tries to maintain \nprejudice towards his shishya.  Also, anger can arise when a person is \ninsulted, out of jealousy, over where to sit or not to sit, or even \nbecause of the unequal distribution of Bhagvãn’s prasãd.  In this way, \nthere are many reasons for anger to arise. \n \n8.4 \n“If a senior sãdhu or a junior sãdhu becomes angry, he should first \nperform dandvat pranãm to whomever he has expressed his anger \nupon, and then please that person by speaking pleasant words to him \nin a pleading, gentle, and sincere tone.  This is my ãgnã. \n \n8.5 \n“If anyone else, due to a cruel intellect, has an offensive thought \ntowards a sãdhu, he should confess and voice his offensive thought \nby saying, ‘Mahãrãj, I have thought offensively of you’.  Then, in order \nto be forgiven for that thought, he should fold his hands and pray for \nforgiveness. \n \n8.6 \n“If a sãdhu becomes angry with a grahastha bhakta, then he should \nverbally pray and bow down to him from a seated position; but he \nshould not perform dandvat pranãm before him.  If sãnkhya-yogi \nwomen become angry amongst themselves or on karma-yogi women, \nthey too should pray verbally and bow down from a seated position.  \nOn the other hand, sãnkhya-yogi men should do as the sãdhus do if \nthey become angry upon anyone.   \n \n8.7 \n“In general, whenever we become angry with someone, we should \nrealise that person to be a bhakta of our lord, Shree Nar-Nãrãyan, and \ninstantly abandon our arrogance, bow down to Him, and pray.  \nHowever, a person should never maintain an outward perspective by \nbelieving, ‘I am senior and better than him; whereas he is not senior \nbut a mere junior’.  A person should not entertain such a feeling.  In \nfact, even our ishta-dev, Shree Nar-Nãrãyan, does not keep any \nAMDÃVÃD \n- 660 - \narrogance or anger; so as His followers and the members of this \nUddhav Sampradãy, we should abandon all forms of anger and \narrogance. \n \n8.8 \n“Shree Nar-Nãrãyan will be greatly pleased upon anyone who \nperforms the prãyshchit that I have prescribed for becoming angry.  \nAs a result, that person’s antah-karans will be purified, and all of his \nvicious natures, such as kãm, krodh, abhimãn, lobh, mãn, and matsar, \nwill be destroyed.  Conversely, a person who does not perform \nprãyshchit for becoming angry should be thought of as a snake, not as \na bhakta of Bhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Amdãvãd || 8 || 228 || \n \n \n|| End of Shree Amdãvãd Prakaran ||\nASHLÃLI \n- 661 - \n|| SHREE SWÃMINÃRAYAN VIJAYTETRÃM || \n \nVACHANÃMRUT \nShree Ashlãli Prakaran \n \nAshlãli – 1 \nThe Three Types Of Bhaktas \n \n1.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Chaitra sud 2 [9th April 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj left Amdãvãd with great festivity and \nreached Ashlãli in the evening.  There, He was accommodated in a \nmango grove north of the village and was seated on a platform.  He \nwas dressed entirely in white clothes.  Also, He was wearing beautiful \ngarlands of flowers around His neck, and tassels of flowers were \nhanging from His pãgh.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n1.2 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then said to Muktãnand Swãmi, Brahmãnand Swãmi, \nand all the other sãdhus, “Please listen, I wish to say something.  \nWhoever incompletely realises the nature of Bhagvãn suffers a great \nloss.  That person cannot experience the true bliss of Purushottam \nBhagvãn – who we also call Shree Krishna, Shree Vãsudev, Shree Nar-\nNãrãyan, Parbrahm, and Shree Nãrãyan – nor can he become an \nekãntik bhakta.  Therefore, a person should strengthen his gnãn of \nBhagvãn by great association with an ekãntik bhakta of Bhagvãn who \nhas gnãn.  This is because, without the true gnãn of Bhagvãn even the \nprajãpatis and other creators of the universe have to repeatedly take \nbirth along with the creation, and then ultimately merge back into \nMãyã.  However, they do not attain Akshardhãm, the dhãm of Shree \nPurushottam Bhagvãn.  The reason for this is a flaw in their \nunderstanding.” \n \n1.3 \nThen, all the munis asked, “Mahãrãj, please explain this flaw in their \nunderstanding.” \nASHLÃLI \n- 662 - \n1.4 \nShreeji Mahãrãj said, “Very well.  Please listen as I explain their flaws.  \nFirst of all, they consider the strength of their own actions but not the \nstrength of a person’s refuge in Bhagvãn to be instrumental in their \nkalyãn.  Secondly, they do not realise that becoming akshar-rup and \nserving Shree Purushottam Nar-Nãrãyan is in itself kalyãn. Their \nthird mistake is that they believe the innumerable avatãrs of \nBhagvãn, such as Rãm and Krishna, to be a part of Bhagvãn.  Fourthly, \nat the time of a previous death, they had a thought in their minds, \n‘How are the brahmãnds created?  It would be good to see for once’.  \nSeeing their desire, Bhagvãn engaged them in the creation of the \nbrahmãnds.  They will only become brahm-rup and attain the dhãm of \nBhagvãn when they realise true gnãn by great association with an \nekãntik bhakta of Bhagvãn; and only then will they become eternally \nhappy.  Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvãn should desire nothing but the \nsevã of Bhagvãn.” \n \n1.5 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “There are three types of bhaktas; \nand they can be recognised by their characteristics:  A person who \nworships Bhagvãn with the intention of earning powers to create the \nworld is known as aishvaryãrthi.  He is a kanishth bhakta.  A person \nwho worships Bhagvãn only to experience the ãtmã is known as a \nkaivalyãrthi.  He is a madhyam bhakta.  However, a person who has a \nconstant the singular determination for the sevã of the pratyaksha \nsvarup of Purushottam Bhagvãn is known as a bhagvat-nishtãrthi.  He \nis an uttam bhakta and best bhakta of all.  As all of us have the belief \nof the pratyaksha svarup of Shree Nar-Nãrãyan, we are all \nundoubtedly the best.” \n \n1.6 \nAll who had gathered in the sabhã were overjoyed hearing these \nwords of Shreeji Mahãrãj. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Ashlãli || 1 || 229 || \n \n \n|| End of Shree Ashlãli Prakaran ||\nJETALPUR \n- 663 - \n|| SHREE SWÃMINÃRAYAN VIJAYTETRÃM || \n \nVACHANÃMRUT \nShree Jetalpur Prakaran \n \nJetalpur – 1 \nThe Dvait Philosophy \n \n1.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, about an hour-and-a-half after sunrise on \nChaitra sud 3 [10th April 1826], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj \nwas sitting on a decorated bedstead that had been placed under an \nãsopãlav tree in the mansion in Jetalpur.  He was dressed entirely in \nwhite clothes.  Around His neck, He was wearing several garlands of \nguldãvadi flowers, tassels of dolariyã flowers were dangling from His \npãgh, and two karnikãr flowers had been placed upon both of His \nears.  Also, He was playing with a beautiful lemon in His hands.  A \nsabhã of sãdhus, as well as satsangi men and women from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \n \n1.2 \nThen, addressing the entire sabhã, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “Everyone \nin this world accepts some philosophy or other.  There are two major \ndoctrines:  One is the Dvait philosophy and the other is the Advait \nphilosophy.  Please explain which philosophy should be accepted by \na mumukshu.” \n \n1.3 \nThen, Purushottam Bhatt said in reply, “Mahãrãj, in the Advait \nphilosophy, by believing their ãtmã to be Bhagvãn, people behave as \nthey please.  As a result of this, they fall from the path of kalyãn.  \nTherefore, a mumukshu should accept the Dvait philosophy.” \n \n1.4 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then raised a doubt.  He questioned, “According to \nthe Dvait philosophy, jeev, ishvar, and Mãyã are satya.  But, as long as \nMãyã persists, how can the jeev attain kalyãn?” \n \n1.5 \nPurushottam Bhatt replied, “A person attains kalyãn by performing \npure karmas.” \nJETALPUR \n- 664 - \n1.6 \nAgain, Shreeji Mahãrãj raised a doubt:  “The two types of karmas, \nnivrutti and pravrutti, become merged into Mãyã in the form of \nsushupti.  What is that state of sushupti like?  Well, just as no one is \ncapable of conquering Mount Lokã-Lok, similarly, no jeev is capable \nof conquering the sushupti.  Above that, is Mãyã in its state of \nequilibrium, and it is extremely vast.  No jeev can conquer it.  \nTherefore, the means to go beyond Mãyã is as follows:  When the jeev \ncomes into contact with the pratyaksha svarup of Shree Purushottam \nBhagvãn – who is beyond Mãyã, and who is the destroyer of Mãyã \nand all karmas – or His sant who has attained Bhagvãn, then by \naccepting their refuge, the jeev can go beyond Mãyã.” \n \n1.7 \nAfter delivering this talk, Shreeji Mahãrãj went up into the mansion \nfor His meal.  After dinner, He returned and sat on a decorated \nbedstead under the ãsopãlav tree.  Then, looking lovingly at all the \nsãdhus and bhaktas, He said, “In the beginning, when no one honours \na person, imagine what his nature is like.  Then, when a hundred \npeople begin to follow him, his pride becomes of a different type.  \nAlso, when one thousand people, or ten thousand people, or ten \nmillion people follow him, his pride becomes of a different type \naltogether.  Then, if he becomes like Brahmã, or Shiv, or Indra, and if \nhe is wise, he would realise, ‘My greatness is not due to this status’.  \nWhat is it due to?  Well, greatness is due to the ãtmã, and due to \nassociation with a sant.  This is because even though those like \nBrahmã, Shiv, and Indra are all great, they still crave for the dust from \nthe feet of a sant. \n \n1.8 \n“So, where does the greatness of a sant lie?  Allow me to explain.  The \ngreatness of a sant is not due to wealth, or objects, or any kingdom; \nhis greatness is due to his bhakti and upãsanã of Bhagvãn.  Also, the \nsant has ãtmã-nishthã.  It is due to these qualities that he is great. \n1.9 \n“If a person cannot realise this, then he should develop a belief within \nhis ãtmã that he should be deeply attached to a sant who has attained \nthe pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvãn, and he should believe only that \nJETALPUR \n- 665 - \nsant to be his own self.  However, a person may doubt, ‘How is the \nmaster-servant relationship maintained?’  Well, take the example of \nGãlav Rãjã.  He wanted to perform a sacrifice for which he specifically \nrequired white horses with black ears.  It so happened that those \nblack-eared horses were at the home of Varun.  But, since that region \nwas beyond his reach, he called upon Garud.  Then, having mounted \nGarud, he went there and brought back the horses.  So, does this \nmean that Gãlav Rãjã’s sevã towards Garud diminished?  No, it did not \ndiminish.  Similarly, the purpose of being deeply attached to a sant, \nwho is a knower of Brahm, is that he has the ability of passing \nthrough the eight barriers (jad prakruti).  That is the reason for being \ndeeply attached to such a sant.” \n \n1.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj then added that all should remember this principle, \nas it is the very life of everyone. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Jetalpur || 1 || 230 || \n \n \nJetalpur – 2 \nThe Characteristics Of A Yati \n \n2.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, in the evening of Chaitra sud 4 [11th April \n1826], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead that had been placed in the middle of the courtyard of the \nmandir of Shree Baldevji in Jetalpur.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes, and tassels of dolariyã flowers decorated His pãgh.  Also, He \nhad a handkerchief in His left hand and was turning a mãlã of tulsi \nbeads with His right hand.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n2.2 \nThen, Brahmãnand Swãmi bowed before Shreeji Mahãrãj and asked, \n“Mahãrãj, please reveal who can be called yati?” \n \n2.3 \nShreeji Mahãrãj said, “A person who firmly follows brahm-chãrya and \nhas conquered all of his indriyas should be known as a yati; a person \nJETALPUR \n- 666 - \nwho is like Hanumãnji and Lakshmanji should be known as a yati.  \nWhen Hanumãnji went to Lankã in search of Sitãji on Rãmchandraji’s \ninstruction, he looked at the faces of all the women in Lankã in order \nto recognise her.  As he continued looking, he thought, ‘This is not \nJãnkiji...This one is not Jãnkiji’.  Then, while he was thinking this, he \nsaw Mandodari and thought, ‘Could this be Jãnkiji?’  But, then \nconcluded in his mind, ‘Because of her separation from Rãmchandraji, \nJãnkiji’s body would never be so plump, and she would never be able to \nsleep so soundly’.  With this thought in mind, Hanumãnji turned back.   \n \n2.4 \n“Then, he doubted in his mind, ‘I am a yati; but, could a flaw have \ndeveloped in me by seeing all these women?’  But, then he reconciled to \nhimself, ‘How can there be any flaw in me?  It is because of \nRãmchandraji’s instruction to find Sitãji that I had to look at all these \nwomen’.  He also thought, ‘By Rãmchandraji’s grace, no disturbance \nhas arisen in my indriyas and in my vrutti’.  Thinking this, he \nwandered everywhere to look for Sitãji.  In this way, like Hanumãnji, \na person whose antah-karans remains pure despite being faced by \nsuch vicious influences is called a yati. \n \n2.5 \n“Moreover, while searching for Sitãji in the forest after she was \nabducted, Rãmchandraji and Lakshmanji came to the place where \nSugriv was seated on the Fatak Shilã.  They informed Sugriv, ‘We have \ncome here because Jãnkiji has been abducted.  So, if you know of her \nwhereabouts, please tell us’.  Sugriv replied, ‘Mahãrãj, I did hear the \ncries, “O Ram!  O Ram!” coming from the sky.  Also, some items of \njewellery, which are tied in a piece of cloth, were dropped from above.  I \nhave kept them with me’.  Then, Rãmchandraji requested, ‘Please bring \nthem here so that we can see them’.  Rãmchandraji took the pieces of \njewellery from Sugriv and showed them to Lakshmanji.  First, He \nshowed jewellery worn on the ears, and bracelets worn on the arms, \nbut Lakshmanji did not recognise any of these.  Then, He showed \nsome anklets.  Lakshmanji immediately exclaimed, ‘Mahãrãj, I have \nnever seen Jãnkiji’s body.  In fact, except for her feet, I have not seen any \nother part of Jãnkiji’s body.  The only reason I have been able to \nJETALPUR \n- 667 - \nrecognize the anklets is because whenever I used to go and bow at her \nfeet every evening, I would see her ankles’.  In this way, despite the fact \nthat for fourteen years Lakshmanji was in their service, with the \nexception of Jãnkiji’s feet, he had never intentionally seen her body.  \nSuch a person should be known as a yati.” \n \n2.6 \nHaving said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj commented, “This Brahmãnand \nSwãmi is also like that.” \n \n2.7 \nIn this way, as the sabhã was listening, Shreeji Mahãrãj greatly \npraised Brahmãnand Swãmi as being a yati. \n \n2.8 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj went to the outskirts of the village.  There, He \nsat on a decorated bedstead that had been placed on top of a low, \nbroad platform at the site where the yagnas had been performed.  A \nsabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \n2.9 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please begin a question-answer \ndiscussion.” \n \n2.10 Then, Ãshji-Bhãi Patel asked, “Mahãrãj, what is the nature of the jeev?  \nPlease reveal it to me as it is.” \n \n2.11 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The jeev is achhedhya, abhedhya, \navinãshi, chetan, and the size of an atom.  You may also ask, ‘Where \ndoes the jeev reside?’  Well, it resides in the hruday-ãkãsh, and while \nstaying there it performs different actions.  From there, when it \nwants to see, it does so through the eyes; when it wants to hear \nsounds, it does so through the ears; it smells all types of smells \nthrough the nose; it tastes through the tongue; and through the skin, \nit experiences the pleasures of all feelings.  In addition, it produces \nthoughts through the man, it thinks through the chitt, and it makes \ndecisions through the buddhi.  In this way, through the ten indriyas \nJETALPUR \n- 668 - \nand the four antah-karans, it indulges in all the vishays.  It pervades \nthe entire body from head to toe, yet is distinct from it.  This is the \nnature of the jeev.  It is due to the grace of the pratyaksha svarup of \nPurushottam that a bhakta is able to perceive the jeev as it actually is.  \nOn the other hand, others cannot even begin to realise the nature of \nthe jeev.” \n \n2.12 Having answered the question in this way and pleasing everyone, \nShreeji Mahãrãj bid “Jay Sachidãnand” to the sabhã and retired to the \nmansion to sleep. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Jetalpur || 2 || 231 || \n \n \nJetalpur – 3 \nOvercoming Vãsnã \n \n3.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, in the early morning of Chaitra sud 5 [12th \nApril 1826], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj arrived in the garden \non the western side of the mansion, the place of His residence, in \nJetalpur.  Under a large bordi tree within the garden, He was sitting \nfacing east on a decorated bedstead, with a large, cylindrical pillow, \nthat had been placed on a platform.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  He was also wearing garlands of champã, borsali, and \nguldãvadi flowers around His neck, and tassels of chameli and \ndolariyã flowers were hanging from His pãgh.  Bunches of hajãri \nflowers had been placed upon His ears.  In addition to this, He was \nplaying with a pomegranate and a lemon with both hands.  \nMuktãnand Swãmi, Brahmãnand Swãmi, and other munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him in a sabhã. \n \n3.2 \nShreeji Mahãrãj first thought for a while, and then said, “Everyone \nplease listen, as I wish to speak to you.  For bhaktas of Bhagvãn, there \nis nothing worse than having impure desires.  This is because bhaktas \nwho have such impure desires, even if they stay near me, cannot be \nJETALPUR \n- 669 - \nhappy.  In fact, before engaging in the worship of Bhagvãn, they \nasked, ‘Mahãrãj, please keep us near you’.  However, because they did \nnot eradicate their impure desires, they are miserable.” \n \n3.3 \nThen, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, how are those impure \ndesires eradicated?” \n \n3.4 \nShreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The method for eradicating impure \ndesires is as follows:  Firstly, whenever a person entertains a thought \nwhich disobeys the rules of dharma that have been laid down by me, \nor whenever he thinks cruelly of a sãdhu or a grahastha, he should \nrepeatedly chant ‘Nar-Nãrãyan, Swãminãrãyan’ aloud.  Secondly, he \nshould offer to Bhagvãn the nine types of bhakti coupled with \nknowledge of His greatness and the observance of dharma.  As a \nresult, Bhagvãn resides in his heart and destroys the impure desires.  \nIn fact, just as Bhagvãn freed the elephant from the crocodile’s \nmouth, in the same way, this method that I have just revealed to you \nwill eradicate your impure desires. \n \n3.5 \n“Now, I shall tell you another method which will benefit all of you, so \nplease listen.  A person should never intentionally disobey the rules \nof dharma related to his vartmãns.  If a person does so unknowingly, \nhe should immediately perform prãyshchit for disobeying the \nvartmãns. \n \n3.6 \n“In addition, a person should realise his own self to be the witness; ‘I \nam the ãtmã, which is full of chaitanya; it is beyond all thoughts and \nreason.  This body, which is accompanied by the mind, is not actually \nmy true svarup’. \n \n3.7 \n“Furthermore, if Bhagvãn smiles at someone, or if Bhagvãn calls \nsomeone, or if He performs any other sort of action, he should never \ndevelop hatred towards Him.  A person should absorb this form of \nunderstanding.  However, someone may feel, ‘I have worshipped \nMahãrãj a lot, and I have also performed a great deal of sevã; still, \nMahãrãj does not talk to me.  Instead, He talks to others a lot.  So, I \nJETALPUR \n- 670 - \nmight as well worship Bhagvãn while sitting at home’.  In this way, he \ndevelops hatred towards Bhagvãn.  In that case, I could also believe, \n‘What does this person have to do with me?’  As a result, that person’s \nfuture would be uncertain.  However, I myself do not look at anyone’s \navgun.  In fact, my nature is such that I always look only at people’s \ngun. \n \n3.8 \n“Now, I shall tell you how that bhakta should perceive gun and \neradicate avgun.  If he thinks, ‘What was I like before I came into \nsatsang?  Well, I experienced kãl, karma, birth, death, and the cycle of \nbirths and deaths.  So, how can I develop hatred towards Bhagvãn who \nhas freed me from all of that, who has made me fearless, and who has \nhelped me progress by bestowing noble qualities upon me?  How can I \nignore His wishes and do as I please?’  A bhakta becomes happy only \nwhen he stops hating Bhagvãn by thinking in this way. \n \n3.9 \n“In fact, with the body, nothing is greater than to do as Bhagvãn likes.  \nThat in itself is bhakti.  In fact, only by doing this does a person attain \nBhagvãn.  That is why vicious natures, such as mãn, irshyã, kãm, \nkrodh, and lobh, are all obstacles on the path of kalyãn and should be \ndiscarded. \n \n3.10 “Of those vicious natures, mãn is absolutely the worst of all.  Just look, \na person who has a minor flaw in any other vartmãn still manages to \nsurvive in satsang, whereas those who had mãn have never been able \nto survive.  Therefore, sãdhus must never allow any lapse in the \nobservance of the vartmãns and remaining without mãn.  Be \nextremely vigilant.  Believe your own self to be distinct from your \nbody.  Offer bhakti to Shree Purushottam attentively and thoroughly.  \nConstantly engage in bhajan and smaran of Bhagvãn; its bliss will \nequal the bliss of actually having the darshan of Bhagvãn. \n \n3.11 “Also, in our satsang, a person who is educated in the shãstras is not \nnecessarily great.  Who should be considered great?  Well, a person \nwho considers all fourteen loks to be as insignificant as a blade of \ngrass, due to vairãgya; a persons who has firm belief of Bhagvãn as \nJETALPUR \n- 671 - \nHe is, just as he has firm attachment to his body; and a person who is \noblivious to the world in the jãgrat state just as he is oblivious to the \nworld in the state of sushupti sleep – such a person is great in our \nsatsang.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Jetalpur || 3 || 232 || \n \n \nJetalpur – 4 \nSevã Of A Bhakta \n \n4.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on the Chaitra sud 6 [13th April 1826], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress, and \nleaning on a large, cylindrical pillow, that had been placed in the \nsouth-facing balcony of the mansion in Jetalpur.  He was wearing a \nwhite pãgh, adorned with a bunch of small flowers, on His head, and \nHe had covered Himself with a pachhedi of white flowers.  He was \nwearing a white khes with a border of silver threads.  In addition to \nthis, His entire body had been smeared with sandalwood paste mixed \nwith saffron.  Also, garlands of guldãvadi flowers were placed around \nHis neck.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \n \n4.2 \nThen, addressing the entire sabhã, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “In this lok, \nthe jeev attains kalyãn only by the following means; nishchay in the \npratyaksha svarup of Bhagvãn, His darshan, and His constant \nremembrance.  After all, it is said in the Shreemad Bhãgvat that even \nthose who insulted Bhagvãn, such as Kans, Shishupãl, and Dantvakra, \nattained kalyãn since all of them had constant remembrance of \nBhagvãn.  Therefore, kalyãn is attained by constantly remembering \nBhagvãn; and since all of you possess such remembrance, your \nkalyãn is assured. \n \n4.3 \n“Having said that, you should still follow all the rules of dharma \nprescribed by me for as long as you are conscious of your bodies.  \nJETALPUR \n- 672 - \nYou may claim, ‘If a person has attained Bhagvãn and constantly \nremembers Him, why does he need to observe vartmãn?’  In reply to \nthat, consider the difference between a person who firmly observes \nthe vartmãn and a person who is slacking in his observance.  Allow \nme to explain that difference to you.  Even though both remember \nBhagvãn, the person who does not follow niyams can only earn \nkalyãn for himself, but he cannot help other jeevs attain kalyãn.  Also, \nhe does not become an ekãntik bhakta, nor does he attain the nirgun \ndhãm of Bhagvãn.  Even though he does not have to undergo births \nand deaths, he cannot stay in the satsang. \n \n4.4 \n“However, all of you are the best type of bhaktas.  In fact, sãdhus such \nas yourselves, who observe niyams, are of a totally different category.  \nFor that reason, whoever feeds you sincerely will earn the rewards of \nperforming millions of sacrifices and will ultimately attain kalyãn; \nand whoever touches your feet will be freed of their sins committed \nin millions of past lives.  Anyone who kindly offers you clothes will \nalso attain ultimate kalyãn.  The rivers and lakes into which you dip \nyour feet become like places of pilgrimage, and any tree that you \nhave sat under or eaten fruits of will also definitely benefit.  If \nsomeone devoutly performs your darshan, or is someone devoutly \nbows before you, then all of his sins are destroyed.  Moreover, \nwhomever you talk to about Bhagvãn and whomever you inspire to \nfollow niyams related to dharma will attain kalyãn.  All the actions of \nsãdhus like yourselves, who observe niyams, lead to moksh.  This is \nbecause you have the firm refuge of the pratyaksha svarup of Shree \nNar-Nãrãyan Rushi.  That Shree Nar-Nãrãyan Rushi is always present \nin your sabhã. \n \n4.5 \n“You may claim, ‘If we have a firm refuge of Bhagvãn, why do mãyik \nqualities still pervade us?’  Then, let me say that it takes me no time at \nall to eradicate the shad-urmi (six physical and emotional feelings) \nand the mãyik qualities from all of you.  In fact, it would take me no \ntime to enable all of you to recall your countless previous lives and to \nJETALPUR \n- 673 - \nbe able to perform the creation, sustenance, and destruction, of \ncountless brahmãnds.  Nevertheless, I have kept you like this and \nhave suppressed your powers because it is my wish to do so, and to \nallow you to attain the bliss of the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvãn.  \nWhat is more, all of you have currently attained Shree Purushottam \nwho is pratyaksha in the svarup of Shree Nar-Nãrãyan Rushi.  \nTherefore, abandon all doubts and happily engage in worship.”  \nSaying this, Shreeji Mahãrãj became silent. \n \n4.6 \nThen, Ãshji-Bhãi asked a question:  “Mahãrãj, how is it that a person \nattains kalyãn by keeping hatred towards Bhagvãn?  Please tell us.” \n \n4.7 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Once Drupad Rãjã wished to have his \ndaughter, Draupadi, married.  So that she could select a bridegroom, \nhe arranged a grand function in which he invited all the kings.  Dron-\nÃchãrya also came, as did the Pãndavs.  Then, all the kings took turns \nto try and pierce the fish, but none were able to do so.  Then, \nYudhishthir said, ‘I will pierce the fish’.  Having said this, Yudhishthir \ntook aim.  Dron-Ãchãrya asked him, ‘Can you see this sabhã?’  \nYudhishthir replied, ‘Yes, I can see it’.  Again, Dron-Ãchãrya asked \nhim, ‘Can you see your body?’  Yudhishthir replied, ‘Yes, I can see it’.  \nThen, Dron-Ãchãrya said, ‘You will not be able to pierce the fish’.  In \nthis way, four of the brothers were unable to pierce the fish.  Then, \nArjun stepped forward.  He picked up his bow and took aim.  Dron-\nÃchãrya asked him, ‘Can you see this sabhã?’  Arjun replied, ‘No, I \ncannot see the sabhã, and I cannot even see the fish.  Instead, I only see \nthe bird attached to the fish’.  Hearing this, Dron-Ãchãrya said, ‘Focus \non its head’.  Arjun adjusted his aim and said, ‘Now I do not see even \nthe bird; I see only its head’.  Finally, Dron-Ãchãrya said, ‘Now take \nyour shot’.  Arjun then pierced the fish’s head.  In this way, if all of a \nperson’s vruttis are focused on the svarup of Bhagvãn, then he can \nattain kalyãn even with a feeling of hatred towards Bhagvãn. \n \n4.8 \n“For example, when the vruttis of those like Shishupãl and Kans \nbecame completely engrossed in Shree Krishna, they attained kalyãn.  \nJETALPUR \n- 674 - \nBut, if a person does not know how to hate Bhagvãn in this way then \nhe is sent to Narak.  Instead, it is much easier to engage in the bhakti \nof Bhagvãn.  However, a person who worships Bhagvãn with such a \ncruel intellect will always be called demonic, and cannot be called a \nbhakta. \n \n4.9 \n“Therefore, if a person wants to abandon the evil practices of the \ndemons and join the ranks of Dhruv, Prahlãd, Nãrad, and the \nSanakãdik, then engaging in the worship of Bhagvãn by offering \nbhakti is far better.” \n \n4.10 Having heard Shreeji Mahãrãj speak in this way, everyone in the \nsabhã experienced profound bliss. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Jetalpur || 4 || 233 || \n \n \nJetalpur – 5 \nThe Wish Of Bhagvãn \n \n5.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, approximately four-and-a-half hours after \nsunset on Chaitra sud 7 [14th April 1826], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji \nMahãrãj was sitting on a wooden bedstead facing north in the \ncourtyard south of the palace in Jetalpur.  He was dressed entirely in \nwhite clothes.  He had tied a pãgh made from a thin, white cloth \naround His head.  He had also covered Himself with a chãdar, and \nwas wearing a white dhoti.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n5.2 \nAfter thinking for a moment, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Everyone please \npay attention; today I wish to talk to you about things as they really \nare.  Specifically, there is nothing greater than worshipping Bhagvãn.  \nThis is because everything happens according to the wish of \nBhagvãn.  In fact, at this moment, even the wishes of this sabhã can \nJETALPUR \n- 675 - \nbe fulfilled.  By the grace of Shree Nar-Nãrãyan, even my wish can be \nfulfilled.  Allow me to elaborate on this. \n \n5.3 \n“Whatever I wish in my mind is fulfilled in this world.  If I wish, ‘May \nhe attain a kingdom’, then he will attain a kingdom.  If I wish, ‘May he \nlose his kingdom’, then his kingdom will be lost.  If I wish, ‘Let there be \nthis much rainfall here at his moment’, then it will definitely rain here; \nand if I wish, ‘Let there be no rainfall here’, then it will not rain here.  \nAlso if I wish, ‘May he attain wealth’, then he does so; and if I wish, \n‘May she conceive a son’, then she mothers a son; and if I wish, ‘May \nshe not have a son’, then she definitely does not.  If I wish, ‘May he \ncontract a disease’, then he will contract a disease; and if I wish, ‘May \nhe not contract a disease’, then he will not contract a disease.  So, \nwhen I wish for something, it actually happens that way. \n \n5.4 \n“Then, you will argue that a satsangi still has to endure joy and pain – \nhe contracts diseases, he sometimes loses all of his wealth and \nluxuries, and despite working extremely hard all his life, he still \nremains poor.  Well, the explanation for all of his efforts not earning \nrewards is that it occurs in direct proportion to his slackness in \nengaging in the worship of Bhagvãn.  Bhagvãn definitely wishes to \nassist him.  In fact, if His own bhakta is to face the pain of a shuli, \nBhagvãn will reduce that pain by having him pricked by a mere thorn \ninstead.  As far as I am concerned, I feel, ‘If a satsangi is to suffer the \npain of a scorpion sting, may I suffer that pain a thousand times \ninstead, but a bhakta should be relieved of that pain and remain \nhappy’.  This is the vardãn I had requested from Rãmãnand Swãmi.  \nThat is why I pray, ‘May good be bestowed upon all’. \n \n5.5 \n“Also, I am always trying to keep the vrutti of people’s minds fixed on \nBhagvãn.  This is because I know everything about the past, the \npresent, and the future.  In fact, while sitting here, I know everything \nthat happens; even when I was in my mother’s womb, I knew \neverything; and even before I came into my mother’s womb, I knew \nJETALPUR \n- 676 - \neverything.  This is because I am Bhagvãn – Shree Nar-Nãrãyan Rushi.  \nEven if a person who has committed extremely great sins comes and \naccepts my refuge and abides by the niyams, then in his last \nmoments, I will grant him my darshan and take him to Bhagvãn’s \nAkshardhãm. \n \n5.6 \n“Presently, the lord of Akshardhãm, Shree Purushottam, being born of \nDharma-Dev and Murti-Devi, takes birth in Badrikãshram and \nperforms tap in the svarup of Shree Nar-Nãrãyan Rushi.  It is to \ndestroy the beliefs of the hypocrites, to destroy any traditions of \nadharma and nurture the traditions of dharma, and to increase \nbhakti coupled with dharma, gnãn, and vairãgya on this earth in this \nKali-Yug that Shree Nar-Nãrãyan Rushi was born to Dharma-Dev and \nBhakti in the svarup of Nãrãyan-Muni – who is presently seated in the \nsabhã.” \n \n5.7 \nBy saying this, Shreeji Mahãrãj filled His bhaktas with joy. \n \n5.8 \nContinuing, He said, “The only purpose behind my repeatedly \nmentioning the predominance of Shree Nar-Nãrãyan Dev is because \nthat same Shree Nar-Nãrãyan, who is Shree Krishna Purushottam and \nwho resides in Akshardhãm, Himself sits daily in this sabhã.  This is \nwhy I speak of His predominance.  So, realising my svarup, I have \nspent hundreds of thousands of rupees on constructing a shikhar-\nbandh mandir in Amdãvãd.  That is why I first installed the murtis of \nShree Nar-Nãrãyan in that mandir.  That Shree Nar-Nãrãyan is the \nlord of countless brahmãnds.  Of these, He is especially the lord of this \nBharat-Khand.  Those people in Bharat-Khand who ignore this \npratyaksha svarup of Shree Nar-Nãrãyan by worshipping other devs \nare like adulterous women who leave their husbands and become \nattached to other lovers.  Even the Shreemad Bhãgvat mentions that \nShree Nar-Nãrãyan is the lord of this Bharat-Khand. \n \n5.9 \n“Furthermore, it is for the kalyãn of the jeevs that I have taken birth \non earth along with the sãdhus.  Therefore, if you abide by my words, \nJETALPUR \n- 677 - \nI will take all of you to the dhãm from which I have come.  So, you \nshould also realise, ‘We have already attained kalyãn’.  Furthermore, \nif you keep firm faith in me and do as I say, then even if you were to \nsuffer extreme suffering, or even if you were to face the distress of \nseven consecutive famines, I will protect you from them.  Even if you \nwere made to suffer miseries from which there seems to be no way \nout, I will still protect you – but only if you thoroughly follow the \ndharma of my satsang, and only if you continue practising satsang.  \nHowever, if you do not, you will suffer terrible miseries, and I will \nhave nothing to do with you. \n \n5.10 “This time, I have left no deficiency in any matter whatsoever.  Just \nlook, I have performed several yagnas in the village of Jetalpur.  I \nhave also been visiting here for so many years; I must have bathed in \nthis lake along with my sãdhus thousands of times; I have must have \nvisited each home in this village of Jetalpur a hundred times, and I \nhave also taken meals in every home.  In this way, I have made this \nvillage and its outskirts even more sacred than Vrundãvan.” \n \n5.11 As Mahãrãj was saying this, a large ball of light appeared in the sky, \nand then split into three distinct balls.  They then hovered about the \nmansion for a while and then disappeared. \n \n5.12 Seeing this phenomenon, everyone asked, “Mahãrãj, what was that?” \n \n5.13 Shreeji Mahãrãj revealed, “Everyday, Brahmã, Vishnu, and Shiv come \nfor my darshan and the darshan of this sabhã of sãdhus.  But today, by \nthe wish of Bhagvãn, you have been able to see them along with their \nvimãns.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Jetalpur || 5 || 234 || \n \n \n|| End of Shree Jetalpur Prakaran ||\nGADHADÃ III \n- 678 - \n|| SHREE SWÃMINÃRAYAN VIJAYTETRÃM || \n \nVACHANÃMRUT \nShree Gadhadã Antya Prakaran \n \nGadhadã III – 1 \nThe Shikshãpatri \n \n1.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on Vaishãkh vad 11 [1st June 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed upon a beautifully coloured, \ndecorated cot.  The bedstead rested on the high veranda outside the \nwest-facing rooms in the courtyard of the mandir of Shree Vãsudev-\nNãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  Beautiful tassels of mogrã flowers \ndecorated the large, white pãgh that was tied around His head.  Also, \na garland of mogrã flowers was hanging around His neck, and a string \nof flowers decorated His wrists.  A sabhã of munis, as well \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n1.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked the paramhans, “What is the \nunderstanding of a bhakta who experiences no obstacles in his bhakti \ntowards Bhagvãn, despite facing unpleasant circumstances?” \n \n1.3 \nThe paramhans replied according to their understanding, but they \nwere unable to provide a precise answer. \n \n1.4 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A person who worships Bhagvãn needs \nfirm vairãgya, and ãtmã-nishthã.  If vairãgya is lacking, then when he \nobtains desired objects, he will also develop love for those objects in \nthe same way that he has love for Bhagvãn.  If ãtmã-nishthã is \nlacking, then when the body experiences pain or pleasure, that \nbhakta’s vruttis become disturbed.  Then, he develops love for \nanything he considers to be full of happiness, and hates anything he \nGADHADÃ III \n- 679 - \nconsiders to be full of misery.  In this way, his mind becomes \npolluted.  Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvãn needs extremely firm ãtmã-\nnishthã as well as extremely firm vairãgya. \n \n1.5 \n“This is because, by vairãgya, all worldly forms except for Bhagvãn’s \nmurti are proven false; and through ãtmã-nishthã, worldly pleasures \nand miseries are proven false.  A person who does not have the ãtmã-\nnishthã and vairãgya, even though he has attained nirvikalp samãdhi, \nexperiences happiness and peace only while he remains in samãdhi.  \nBut, when he comes out of samãdhi, he becomes attached to \npleasurable object upon seeing them, as Nãrãyan-Dãs did.” \n \n1.6 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A bhakta of Bhagvãn either has the \nstrength of gnãn or the strength of love towards Bhagvãn.  Of these, a \nperson who has the strength of gnãn understands the greatness of \nBhagvãn and cannot stay without Bhagvãn even for a moment.  For \nexample, Jhinã-Bhãi, Dev-Rãm, and Prabhã-Shankar have the \nstrength of gnãn.  Such bhaktas who understand the greatness of \nBhagvãn should be known as having the strength of gnãn.  A bhakta \nwho has love for Bhagvãn, like the gopis of Vraj, should be known as \nhaving the strength of love. \n \n1.7 \n“Of these, a person who has the strength of gnãn realises Bhagvãn as \nbeing antaryãmi and believes, ‘Bhagvãn does not make judgements \nbased on what He hears from others.  Instead, Bhagvãn recognises a \nbhakta’s strengths and speaks to him accordingly, but He does not act \nbased on the advice of others’.  Conversely, a person who believes, \n‘Bhagvãn lectures me based on someone else’s words, even though I am \nnot at fault’, has no gnãn of Bhagvãn. \n \n1.8 \n“Even in worldly life we notice that a person who has selfish motives \nof gaining something from another will never see the other person’s \nfaults.  This is because his love is based on self-interest.  Similarly, if a \nperson has the self-interest that Bhagvãn will free him from the fear \nof births and deaths, then he will never perceive faults in Bhagvãn.  \nGADHADÃ III \n- 680 - \nBut, a person who perceives faults in Bhagvãn by thinking, ‘Bhagvãn \nchanges His opinion based on the prompting of others’, has neither the \nstrength of gnãn nor the strength of love.” \n \n1.9 \nHaving said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj said to the senior paramhans, \n“Please reveal which of these two is your strength.” \n \n1.10 All the paramhans replied, “We have the strength of gnãn.” \n \n1.11 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, “A person who has the strength of \nlove will do anything for his loved one, even that which is not fit to be \ndone.  For example, in the world, thieves have love for their wives \nand children.  However, when they go to steal, they kill other people \nand pass on the money to their own family.  In reality, that thief is \nquite cruel, but since he has love for his own family, he is not cruel \ntowards them.  Similarly, a person who has love for Bhagvãn and His \nbhaktas can never become angry at or jealous of Bhagvãn or His \nbhaktas, and in no way does he perceive faults to them.  A person \nwho has such love can be said to have the strength of love.  A person \nwith neither the strength of gnãn nor the strength of love is said to be \nfickle and unpredictable.” \n \n1.12 Having delivered this talk, Shreeji Mahãrãj returned to His residence. \n \n1.13 On the evening of that same day, Shreeji Mahãrãj was seated on a \nmattress with a cylindrical pillow placed on a decorated bedstead on \nthe veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr.  \nHe was dressed entirely in white clothes.  He was also wearing a \ngarland of mogrã flowers around His neck.  A sabhã of munis, as well \nas haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.  Some \nsãdhus were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a dukad and \nsarodã. \n \n1.14 When the sãdhus had finished singing, Shreeji Mahãrãj addressed the \nsabhã:  “The Shikshãpatri which I have written should be read daily \nGADHADÃ III \n- 681 - \nby all of my followers – tyãgi sãdhus and brahm-chãris, as well as all \nmale and female grahasthas.  Those who do not know how to read \nshould listen to it daily; and those who do not have the facility to \nlisten to it should worship it daily.  I have stated this in the \nShikshãpatri itself.  A person should do upvãs on the day he fails to do \nany of the three.  This is my ãgnã.” \n \n1.15 Then, everyone promised to follow this ãgnã of Shreeji Mahãrãj by \nsaying, “O Mahãrãj, we will do as you have said.” \n \n1.16 Hearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj became extremely pleased.  He \nembraced all the sãdhus and brahm-chãris and imprinted His holy \nfootprints on the chests of all the satsangis. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 1 || 235 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 2 \nUnderstanding Bhagvãn’s Greatness \n \n2.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1882, on the evening of Jyeshth sud 6 [11th June \n1826], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a low, \nwooden seat in the courtyard of the mandir or Shree Vãsudev-\nNãrãyan  in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was wearing a \nwhite khes and had covered Himself with a white chãdar.  He had also \ntied a black-bordered, white pãgh around His head, and tassels of \nmogrã flowers had been inserted in the pãgh.  A sabhã of munis, as \nwell as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n2.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj posed a question:  “A person sees that the \nworld is perishable and that the chaitanya separates from the body \nand leaves it; however, the predominance of the world does not \ndiminish from his heart.  Despite thoroughly believing Bhagvãn to be \nan ocean of bliss, his mind still does not focus on Bhagvãn.  Also, \nGADHADÃ III \n- 682 - \nsatsang does not become predominant in his heart and he cannot \neradicate love for wealth, women, and other pleasures of the world.  \nWhat can be the reason for this?” \n \n2.3 \nThen, Muktãnand Swãmi replied, “The person lacks vairãgya.  As a \nresult, he cannot eradicate the predominance of the world from his \nheart, and nor can he develop love for Bhagvãn.” \n \n2.4 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then clarified, “It is true that there is a deficiency in \nvairãgya, but it appears to me that the strength which forms as a \nperson practices satsang, remains as it is forever; a different strength \ndoes not develop.  By practicing satsang, that strength may be \nnourished, but the strength itself remains unchanged.  Whenever a \nperson’s strength is being formed, his mind becomes disturbed in the \nprocess of formation.  Just as the mind of an extremely lustful person \nis disoriented by lust, and the mind of an extremely angry person is \ndisoriented by anger, and the mind of an extremely greedy person is \ndisoriented by greed, similarly, a person’s mind becomes disoriented \nin the process of developing his strength.  Then, during the \ndisturbance, whichever strength develops is the strength that \nremains.  Therefore, a person who is wise should realise his own \nstrength.  When a person is disturbed by the influence of vicious \nnatures, such as lust or anger, if he thinks about his own strength, the \ninfluence of the vicious natures is lessened. \n \n2.5 \n“In addition, just as a grahastha feels regretful if he experiences \nlustful thoughts on seeing his attractive mother, sister, or daughter, \nsimilarly, a person should feel regretful when objects other than \nsatsang become predominant in his heart.  If a person does not feel \nsimilarly regretful on entertaining thoughts for indecent objects, then \nsatsang does not remain predominant in his heart.   \n \n2.6 \n“In fact, the reward of all spiritual activities is satsang.  In the \neleventh skandh of the Shreemad Bhãgvat, Shree Krishna Bhagvãn \nsays to Uddhav, ‘I am not as pleased by ashtãng-yog, thoughts of \nGADHADÃ III \n- 683 - \nsãnkhya, scriptural study, tap, tyãg, yog, yagna, and vrats, as I am \npleased by satsang’.  In fact, it appears to me that all sanskãrs a person \nhas gathered from previous lives have been attained through \nassociation with a sat-purush.  Even today, those who obtain sanskãrs \ndo so through association with a sat-purush.  A person who has \nattained the association of such a sat-purush, but is still unable to \nunderstand matters as they really are should be known to have an \nextremely dull intellect. \n \n2.7 \n“As for me, I consider this sabhã of satsangis to be far greater than the \nsabhãs in Shvet-Dvip, Golok, Vaikunth, and Badrikãshram; and I see all \nof these bhaktas as being extremely luminous.  I take oath on this \nsabhã of sãdhus that there is not even the slightest lie in this matter.  \nWhy do I have to take oath in this way?  Well, it is because not \neveryone understands such divinity, nor can they see it; that is why I \nhave to take an oath. \n \n2.8 \n“Therefore, even after attaining this satsang – which is rare for even \nBrahmã – affection for objects other than Bhagvãn still remains.  This \nis because the person has not developed as firm a belief for the \npratyaksha svarup of Bhagvãn as he has for the non-pratyaksha \nsvarup of Bhagvãn.  That is why the Shrutis state, ‘If a person develops \nbelief in his guru – who is the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvãn – in the \nsame way that he has belief in the non-pratyaksha devs, then as a \nresult, he attains all the purushãrths (dharma, arth, kãm, and moksh) \nwhich are described as attainable’.  In fact, when he attains the \ncompany of such a sant, he has attained He who was to be attained \nafter death, while still alive; he has attained that which is called \nmoksh or kalyãn, while being alive. \n \n2.9 \n“What I have just explained to you may appear to be simple, but in \nreality, it is extremely subtle.  A person who is currently behaving in \nthis way will understand that this is extremely subtle; but others will \nnot even be able to understand it.  That is how subtle it is.” \nGADHADÃ III \n- 684 - \n2.10 After delivering this talk, Shreeji Mahãrãj bid “Jay Sachidãnand” to \neveryone and then returned to His residence.   \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 2 || 236 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 3 \nCompassion And Love \n \n3.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1883, on Ashãdh vad 1 [20th July 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was at His residence in Dãdã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Gadhadã.  On that day, Harji Thakkar invited Shreeji \nMahãrãj to sanctify his house.  Shreeji Mahãrãj sat on a mattress with \na cylindrical pillow on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside \nthe east-facing rooms.  Harji Thakkar then performed pujã of Shreeji \nMahãrãj with sandalwood paste mixed with saffron.  In this way, \nShreeji Mahãrãj sat facing east and was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  Garlands of mogrã flowers were hanging around His neck, \ngajarã of mogrã flowers were tied around both arms, and tassels of \nmogrã flowers beautifully decorated His pãgh.  A sabhã of munis, as \nwell as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n3.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked the entire sãdhu-mandal, “Compassion \nand love reside instinctively in the heart of a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  Of \nthe two, the nature of love is like honey; it sticks everywhere.  The \nnature of compassion is that a person feels compassion towards \neverything.  When Bharatji felt compassion for a deer, he had to take \nbirth from the womb of a deer in his next life.  Moreover, a person \nwho is compassionate certainly develops love towards those he has \ncompassion for. \n \n3.3 \n“There are two methods for eradicating compassion and love:  ãtmã-\nnishthã and vairãgya.  Of these, ãtmã-nishthã is such that nothing else \ncan penetrate it.  The nature of vairãgya is that it shows all objects to \nbe perishable.  Therefore, through ãtmã-nishthã and vairãgya, \nGADHADÃ III \n- 685 - \ncompassion and affection are destroyed.  In addition, the influences \nof the sthul, sukshma, and kãran bodies are destroyed, and then only \nbrahm-sattã remains.  But then, does a bhakta have compassion and \nlove for Bhagvãn and His bhaktas?  Or does he not?  That is the \nquestion.” \n \n3.4 \nMuktãnand Swãmi, Shuk Muni, Nityãnand Swãmi, and other \nparamhans answered according to the extent of their understanding.  \nHowever, none could give a satisfactory reply to Shreeji Mahãrãj’s \nquestion. \n \n3.5 \nSo, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Allow me to answer.  The answer is that by \ngnãn and vairãgya, the chaitanya is freed from the mãyik influences \nof the three bodies, the three mental states, and the three gun of \nMãyã.  It is then pure, and not the slightest trace of mãyik influence \nremains.  For example, consider the analogy of an oil lamp’s flame.  \nOnly when a wick-holder, some oil, and a wick unite can the flame of \nan oil lamp be seen and recognised.  But, when the combination of \nthese three components is broken, the flame can no longer be seen by \nanyone, nor can it be recognised by anyone.  Therefore, only when \nthose components are combined is it seen and recognised.  Similarly, \nwhen all the mãyik influences are overcome by gnãn and vairãgya, \nthe jeevãtmã remains as pure brahm-sattã. \n \n3.6 \n“Now, the jeevãtmã is invisible to the mind and speech, and it is not \nperceivable by any of the indriyas.  However, with time, if it attains \nthe knowledge of Bhagvãn by associating with a pure sampradãy, and \nit fully understands the greatness of Bhagvãn and His bhaktas, then it \nis freed from all mãyik influences.  Then, that jeevãtmã also becomes \nbrahm-rup.  However, compassion and love for Bhagvãn and His \nbhaktas still remains forever.  To carry the analogy of the oil lamp \nfurther, when the combination of its components is broken, its flame \nremains within the air, where it cannot be perceived by any of the \nindriyas.  However, the fragrance or foul smell that had pervaded that \nflame is not destroyed.  Even though the air is more superior to the \nGADHADÃ III \n- 686 - \nflame, it still becomes pervaded by fragrant or foul smells.  Likewise, \nby gnãn and vairãgya, the jeevãtmã is freed from mãyik influences, \nbut the impression of satsang is not lost.  Even though it becomes \nbrahm-rup, like Nãrad, the Sanakãdik, and Shukji, it behaves with \nintense compassion and love for Bhagvãn and His bhaktas.  The \nfollowing verses illustrate this: \n \nparinishthitopi nairgunya uttama-shloka-leelãya \ngruheeta-cheta rãjarshe akhyanam yad-adheetavan \nO King (Parikshit)!  Despite being perfectly poised in the nirgun state, having \nbeen attracted by the leelãs of Bhagvãn, I (Shukdevji) studied the Shreemad \nBhãgvat. \n \nharer-gunãkshipta-matir-bhagavãn bãdarãyanihi \nadhyagãn-mahad-ãkhyãnam nityam vishnu vishnu-jana-priyaha \nHonourable (Shukdevji) – son of Vyãs, to whom bhaktas of Vishnu are very \ndear – was attracted by the gun of Bhagvãn, and therefore constantly studied \nthe great Shreemad Bhãgvat. \n \nãtmãrãmãsh-cha-munayo... \nDespite being engaged in the ãtmã and having overcome all improper natures, \nthe munis still offer selfless bhakti to Bhagvãn because He possesses such divya \nqualities. \n \nprãyena Munayo rãjan... \nO King [Parikshit]!  Although the munis had no need for the rules of moral \nconduct and had attained the nirgun state, they still engaged themselves in \npraising the glory of Bhagvãn. \n \n \n“The Geetã also states: \n \nbrahma-bhootaha prasannãtmã na shochati na kãnkshati \nsamaha sarveshu bhooteshu mad-bhaktim labhate parãm \nA person, who has become brahm-rup remains joyful, grieves nothing, desires \nnothing, behaves equally with all beings and attains my supreme bhakti. \n \n3.7 \n“In this way, many verses promote the view that bhaktas of Bhagvãn \nwho have shed mãyik influences and have become brahm-rup by \nGADHADÃ III \n- 687 - \ngnãn and vairãgya, still have compassion and love for Bhagvãn and \nHis bhaktas.  On the other hand, a person who is not a bhakta of \nBhagvãn, but has overcome mãyik influences by ãtmã-nishthã and \nvairãgya alone and behaves as the ãtmã, has been influenced by \nkusang during the process of realising Bhagvãn, who has only ãtmã-\nnishthã and do not have upãsanã of Bhagvãn.  As a result, he does not \ndevelop compassion and love for bhaktas of Bhagvãn.  Just as a foul \nsmell lingers in the air and in fire, similarly, the impressions of \nkusang, which cannot be overcome by any means, lingers within him. \n \n3.8 \n“For example, Ashvatthãmã was brahm-rup, but he was influenced by \nkusang.  Therefore, he did not develop compassion or love for Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn or His bhaktas, the Pãndavs.  Similarly, the \nimpressions of kusang do not disappear in a person who has only \nknowledge of the ãtmã, even though he becomes brahm-rup; nor \ndoes he develop compassion and love for Bhagvãn and His bhaktas.  \nHowever, for a bhakta of Bhagvãn, even though mãyik influences are \novercome, intense compassion and love for Bhagvãn and His bhaktas \nincrease.  But, in no way are compassion and love ever lost; they \nalways remain.” \n \n3.9 \nAfter delivering this talk, Shreeji Mahãrãj bid “Jay Sachidãnand” to \neveryone and then returned to His residence. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 3 || 237 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 4 \nBãdhitãnu Vrutti \n \n4.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1883, on Shrãvan sud 3 [6th August 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting facing north on a mattress \nwith a cylindrical pillow that had been placed on the veranda outside \nthe medi of His residence in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He \nwas dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \nGADHADÃ III \n- 688 - \n4.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Even though a bhakta of Bhagvãn may \npossess gnãn and vairãgya, and even if by the force of a thought \nprocess the bhakta has overcome affection for mãyik objects that \ncause him bondage, until he attains nirvikalp samãdhi, bãdhitãnu \nvrutti still remains within. \n \n4.3 \n“Until a bhakta of Bhagvãn attains nirvikalp samãdhi – even though \nhe may possess gnãn and vairãgya, and by the force of a thought \nprocess has overcome affection for mãyik objects that cause him \nbondage – bãdhitãnu vrutti remains within him.  Due to this, he \ndoubts, ‘Maybe attachment for my mother, father, wife, children, \nwealth, relatives, body, or property still remains!’  He remains fearful \nin this way.  For example, a brave warrior, even though he has killed \nall of his enemies, still occasionally becomes frightened by even those \ndead enemies; even if he sees them in his dreams, he becomes \nfrightened.  Similarly, due to bãdhitãnu vrutti, even a bhakta \npossessing gnãn is afraid of the bondage of worldly objects that he \nhas proved false from within and from which he has severed all \naffection.  At some time, if he remembers the money he possessed, or \nhis wife or other objects, he becomes fearful in his mind and thinks, \n‘What if they cause bondage?’  In this way, the recalling of objects that \nhave been falsified from within is called bãdhitãnu vrutti. \n \n4.4 \n“Bãdhitãnu vrutti is overcome when nirvikalp samãdhi is attained.  \nThen, that person becomes oblivious of eating and drinking, day and \nnight, pain and pleasure.  But, when he withdraws from nirvikalp \nsamãdhi and enters savikalp samãdhi, bãdhitãnu vrutti still remains.  \nAs a result of the influence of that bãdhitãnu vrutti, when that bhakta \ncontracts a fever or is at the moment of death, he sometimes recalls \nother objects besides Bhagvãn.  At that time, he may babble \nmeaninglessly; he may even say words like, ‘Mother!  Father!’  \nHearing this, a person who does not understand the nature of \nbãdhitãnu vrutti, will perceive faults in that bhakta by thinking, ‘He \nwas called a bhakta of Bhagvãn; so, why does he speak like this at the \nGADHADÃ III \n- 689 - \ntime of death?’  Such faults are perceived without knowing the nature \nof bãdhitãnu vrutti. \n \n4.5 \n“In the world many sinful people die with full consciousness.  Also, a \nsoldier or a Rãjput who has injured his body may die while being \nfully conscious.  That being so, will a vimukh who dies with full \nconsciousness still attain kalyãn, despite being a vimukh?  Of course \nnot; he will certainly be sent to Narak.  Conversely, regardless of \nwhether a bhakta of Bhagvãn dies while engaged in the chanting of \nBhagvãn’s name, or in a disturbed state due to the influence of \nbãdhitãnu vrutti, bhakta still reaches the holy feet of Bhagvãn.” \n \n4.6 \nOn the evening of that same day, Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on the \nveranda outside the medi of His residence.  He was dressed entirely \nin white clothes.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places had gathered before Him. \n \n4.7 \nShreeji Mahãrãj then asked the senior paramhans, “Please describe \nhow the jeev, which resides within the body, is present in one \nlocation, and how it pervades the entire body.” \n \n4.8 \nThe paramhans answered according to their understanding, but none \nwere able to satisfactorily answer Shreeji Mahãrãj’s question. \n \n4.9 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “In the body, just as food is transformed \ninto semen, similarly, in the heart, the five bhuts are transformed into \na disc of flesh, within which the jeev resides.  The jeev clings to this \ndisc of flesh like a torch made of rags that is set alight after being \nimmersed in oil.  Also, just as fire pervades an iron nail, similarly, the \njeev actually resides in the disc of flesh, and by consciousness \npervades the entire body.  Therefore, regardless of where pain is felt \nin the body, it is the jeev itself that feels the pain; so, the jeev cannot \nbe said to be separate from the pleasures and pains of the body. \n \n4.10 “However, some may argue, ‘The jeev is luminous, whereas the disc of \nflesh and the body have no light.  So, how can they be said to have \nGADHADÃ III \n- 690 - \ncombined?’  The answer to this is that just as without the combination \nof oil, a wick-holder and a wick, a flame cannot hover in space on its \nown, similarly, without associating with the disc of flesh the jeev \ncannot remain alone.  Just as fire – which is distinct from the \ncontainer, the oil and the wick – cannot be destroyed by breaking just \nthe container, in the same way, the jeev does not die with the death of \nthe body even though it pervades the disc of flesh and the body.  \nAlthough the jeev does experience pleasure and pain along with the \nbody, it is not perishable like the body.  So, the jeev is indestructible \nand luminous, and it also pervades the body. \n \n4.11 “Furthermore, if an oil lamp is placed at one location in a mandir, its \nflame predominantly pervades the wick; and secondarily, it also \npervades the entire building.  In the same way, the jeev also \npredominantly resides in and pervades the disc of flesh that is a \nproduct of the five bhuts; and secondarily, it resides in and pervades \nthe entire body.  Moreover, Bhagvãn resides within the jeev as a \nwitness.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 4 || 238 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 5 \nBhakti Coupled With The Knowledge Of Bhagvãn’s Greatness \n \n5.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1883, on Bhãdarvã sud 11 [12th September 1826], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow on \nthe veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr \nin Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  He was also \nwearing a garland of mogrã flowers around His neck.  Tassels of \nmogrã flowers decorated His pãgh, and gajarã of mogrã flowers were \ntied around His arms.  A sabhã of the munis, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \nGADHADÃ III \n- 691 - \n5.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Someone please ask a question.” \n \n5.3 \nSo, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, of the various types of bhakti \noffered to Bhagvãn, which type of bhakti does not encounter any \nobstacles, and which type does encounter obstacles?” \n  \n5.4 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “In the third skandh of the Shreemad \nBhãgvat, within the Kapil Geetã, Devhuti says to Kapilji,  \n \nyan-nãmadheya-shravanãnu-keertanãd-yat-prahvanãd-yat-smaranã-dapi kvachit \nshvãdopi sadyaha savanãya kalpate katham punas-te bhagavan-nu darshanãt \nIf even a ‘shvapach’ (a vile person who eats dog-meat) becomes immediately \nsuitable for performing yagnas (perfectly purified) by merely hearing and \nrepeating the name of Bhagvãn, by bowing to Bhagvãn, and by remembering \nBhagvãn, then what can be said of your darshan? \n \naho bata shavpachoto gareeyãn yaj-jiha-vãgre vartate nãma tubhyam \ntepus-tapas-te juhuvuhu sasnur-ãryã bhramã-nuchur-nãma grunanti ye te \nHow amazing!  Even a ‘shvapach’ (a vile person who eats dog-meat) becomes \ngreat if your name is on the tip of his tongue (he chants Bhagvãn’s name).  \nThose who chant your name are the ones who have performed all tap, \nperformed all yagnas, bathed in the sacred waters of all the places of \npilgrimage, and studied all the Veds; they indeed are the ãryãs (the noble \nones). \n \n“The greatness of Bhagvãn is described in these two verses.  Also, \nKapilji describes his own greatness to Devhuti: \n \nmad-bhayãd-vãti vãto-yam suryas-tapati mad-bhagyãt \nvarshateendro dahatyagnir-mrutyush-charati mad-bhayãt \nIt is by fear of me that the Vãyu (wind) blows, Surya (sun) shines, Indra \n(clouds) rains, Agni (fire) burns, and Yam (death) devours the living. \n \n5.5 \n“A person who has bhakti for Bhagvãn coupled with such knowledge \nof His greatness encounters no obstacles in any form.  On the other \nhand, a person who offers bhakti without realising the greatness of \nGADHADÃ III \n- 692 - \nBhagvãn and who perceives worldly characteristics in Him, does \nencounter obstacles.” \n \n5.6 \nMuktãnand Swãmi then asked, “By what means can such bhakti \ncoupled with the knowledge of Bhagvãn’s greatness be developed?” \n \n5.7 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Bhakti coupled with the knowledge of \nBhagvãn’s greatness arises in a person’s heart by serving and \nassociating with renowned sãdhus like Shukji and the Sanakãdik.” \n \n5.8 \nThen, Shuk Muni asked, “One bhakta has perfect nishchay in Bhagvãn, \nand disturbances such as kãm, krodh, lobh, and moh do not arise in \nhis heart.  A second bhakta has perfect nishchay in Bhagvãn, but \ndisturbances such as kãm, krodh, lobh, and moh do arise in his heart.  \nWhen these two types of bhaktas leave their bodies, do they attain \nthe same level of bliss in the dhãm of Bhagvãn, or do they attain \ndifferent levels of bliss?” \n \n5.9 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a bhakta of Bhagvãn whose nishchay is \nperfect and who is not disturbed by inner enemies, but desires \nanything other than the pratyaksha svarup of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, \nthen even if he is a great tyãgi, and has firm vairãgya and intense \nãtmã-nishthã, he will attain a lower level of bliss.  As for the other \nbhakta, even though he also has perfect nishchay in Bhagvãn, when \ninner enemies cause disturbances within, he feels guilt within his \nheart.  But, except for the pratyaksha svarup of Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn, he wishes for no other object.  Then, even if he has only a \nslight amount of ãtmã-nishthã and vairãgya, such a bhakta still \nattains profound bliss in the dhãm of Bhagvãn after leaving his body. \n \n5.10 “This is because the first bhakta superficially appears to be a tyãgi \nand nishkãm.  However, he does not have wish for the murti of \nBhagvãn, but instead has desires for the darshan of the ãtmã and the \nfour types of mukti.  Therefore, he is called a sakãm bhakta.  In the \nhigher loks, he will certainly attain less bliss.  Conversely, the second \nGADHADÃ III \n- 693 - \nbhakta superficially appears to be a sakãm bhakta, but inwardly, that \nbhakta wishes for nothing except the murti of Bhagvãn.  If a desire for \npleasures other than the murti of Bhagvãn arises, he feels intense \nguilt in his mind.  Therefore, he is called a nishkãm bhakta.  When \nsuch a bhakta leaves his body, he attains profound bliss, becomes a \npãrshad of Bhagvãn and develops intense love for the murti of Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 5 || 239 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 6 \nThe Friendship Between The Mind And The Jeev \n \n6.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1883, on Bhãdarvã vad 5 [21st September 1826], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in His residence in \nDãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, \nhad gathered before Him. \n \n6.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj looked compassionately at all the bhaktas and \nsaid, “If a bhakta of Bhagvãn engages in delivering kathãs, singing \nkirtans, listening to talks of Bhagvãn, and the rest of the nine types of \nbhakti with jealousy towards other bhaktas, then Bhagvãn is not very \npleased by that bhakti.  But, if a person discards his jealousy and then \noffers bhakti only for his own kalyãn, and not to display to other \npeople, then Bhagvãn is pleased by that bhakti.  Therefore, a person \nwho wants to please Bhagvãn should not offer bhakti to please other \npeople or out of jealousy for someone, but should do so only for his \nown kalyãn. \n \n6.3 \n“While offering bhakti to Bhagvãn, if a person commits a mistake, he \nshould not blame someone else for that fault.  It is the very nature of \nall people that when they are at fault, they claim, ‘I made a mistake \nbecause someone else misled me; but I am not really at fault’.  A person \nGADHADÃ III \n- 694 - \nwho says this is a fool.  After all, others may say, ‘Go and jump into a \nwell?’  Then, by such words, should a person really jump into a well?  \nOf course not.  Therefore, the fault lies only in the person who makes \nthe mistake, but he blames others. \n \n6.4 \n“Similarly, to blame the indriyas and antah-karans is the foolishness \nof the jeev.  In reality, the jeev and the mind are close mutual friends.  \nTheir friendship is like the friendship between milk and water.  When \nmilk and water are mixed and heated on a fire, water settles below \nthe milk and it burns, but it does not allow the milk to burn.  To save \nthe water, the milk overflows and extinguishes the fire.  Such is their \nfriendship.  The jeev and the mind have a similarly close friendship.  \nSo, the mind never has thoughts of things that the jeev does not like.  \nOnly when the jeev likes something does the mind attempt to \npersuade the jeev.  How does it attempt to persuade it?  Well, when \nthe jeev is performing dhyãn upon Bhagvãn, the mind suggests, ‘You \nshould also perform dhyãn on some female bhakta Bhagvãn’.  The \nmind then makes the jeev think of all of her features.  Then, it forms \nindecent thoughts about her just as it forms indecent thoughts about \nother women. \n \n6.5 \n“But, if the bhakta’s jeev is extremely pure, he will not accept the \narguments of the mind, and instead, he will feel intense sorrow.  \nTherefore, the mind will never entertain such thoughts again.  \nConversely, if his jeev is polluted and sinful, it will accept the \narguments of the mind.  Then, by making the bhakta repeatedly think \nof indecent thoughts, the mind will make him fall from the path of \nkalyãn.  For this reason, a true mumukshu develops intense hatred for \nthe talks of adharma, which are against the path of kalyãn, regardless \nof whether they are suggested by his own mind or by some other \nperson.  Then, his own mind or the other person will not reappear in \nan attempt to persuade him. \n \n6.6 \n“Furthermore, because the mind is a friend of the jeev, it will never \nentertain thoughts which the jeev does not like.  So, when indecent \nGADHADÃ III \n- 695 - \nthoughts are formed in the mind, if the jeev becomes extremely \nfurious with it, such thoughts will never arise in the mind again.  \nTherefore, when indecent thoughts repeatedly arise in the mind, the \nbhakta should understand it to be the fault of his own jeev, not the \nfault of his mind alone. \n \n6.7 \n“If a person offers bhakti to Bhagvãn with this understanding, the evil \ninfluence of some vimukh or his own mind will not be able to affect \nhim even slightly.  Then, he will be able to worship Bhagvãn without \nany obstacles.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 6 || 240 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 7 \nBhagvãn Is Sãkãr \n \n7.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1883, on Bhãdarvã vad 6 [22nd September 1826], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \ncylindrical pillow at His residence in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.

A sabhã of munis, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n7.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said to all the bhaktas, “I shall now tell you my \ndeepest principle.  For a person who desires his own kalyãn, nothing \nin this world is more blissful than Bhagvãn and His sant.  Therefore, \njust as a person is deeply attached to his own body, he should be \nsimilarly attached to Bhagvãn and His sant.  A person should also \nremain absolutely loyal to the bhaktas of Bhagvãn.  Even if while \nkeeping that loyalty his reputation increases or decreases, or he is \nhonoured or insulted, or he lives or dies, in no way should he \nabandon his loyalty to Bhagvãn and His bhaktas.  In addition, he \nshould not allow hatred to develop towards them.  Furthermore, he \nGADHADÃ III \n- 696 - \nshould not have as much love towards his body or bodily relations as \nhe has towards the bhaktas of Bhagvãn.  For a bhakta who behaves in \nthis way, even extremely powerful enemies, such as kãm and krodh, \nare unable to defeat him.” \n \n7.3 \nContinuing, Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Bhagvãn, who possesses a \ndefinite murti, is always present in His dhãm, Akshardhãm.  Bhaktas \nof Bhagvãn, who also possess a svarup, remain in His service in that \ndhãm.  Therefore, a person who has taken firm refuge in the \npratyaksha svarup of Bhagvãn should not have the following fear in \nhis mind:  ‘What if I become a ghost or an evil spirit, or attain the lok of \nIndra or the lok of Brahmã after I die?’  He should not have such \ndoubts in his mind.  After all, a bhakta of Bhagvãn who possesses the \nunderstanding mentioned earlier definitely attains the dhãm of \nBhagvãn; Bhagvãn does not leave him astray anywhere in between.   \n \n7.4 \n“Moreover, the bhakta should firmly keep his mind at the holy feet of \nBhagvãn.  Just as an iron nail that is firmly affixed to an iron surface \ncan never be separated, similarly, a person’s mind should be fixed \nfirmly at the holy feet of Bhagvãn.  When the bhakta has kept his \nmind at the holy feet of Bhagvãn in this way, he does not have to die \nto attain the dhãm of Bhagvãn – he attains it while still alive.” \n \n7.5 \nHaving delivered this talk, Shreeji Mahãrãj bid “Jay Sachidãnand” to \neveryone and then instructed the sabhã to disperse. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 7 || 241 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 8 \nDo Not Keep The Company Of A Vimukh \n \n8.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1883, on Bhãdarvã vad 9 [25th September 1826], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on \nGADHADÃ III \n- 697 - \nthe veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr \nin Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  Garlands of \nmogrã flowers were hanging around His neck, and tassels of mogrã \nflowers decorated His pãgh.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n8.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked the munis, “How can a bhakta of \nBhagvãn remain eternally happy?”  The senior sãdhus replied \naccording to their understanding, but then Shreeji Mahãrãj Himself \nsaid, “The answer is that a bhakta of Bhagvãn who has firm vairãgya \nand has extremely firm svadharma; who has gained control over all \nof his indriyas by these two means; who has intense love for the \nBhagvãn and His bhaktas; who has a close friendship with Bhagvãn \nand His bhaktas; who never becomes indifferent towards Bhagvãn \nand His bhaktas; and who is pleased only by the company of Bhagvãn \nand His bhaktas, but does not like the company of a vimukh – remains \neternally happy in this lok and beyond. \n \n8.3 \n“A person, who has not controlled his indriyas by vairãgya and \nsvadharma remains miserable, despite staying in the company of \nBhagvãn and His bhakta.  This is because a person who has not \ngained control over his indriyas does not experience happiness \nanywhere.  Even while engaged in bhakti towards Bhagvãn, when the \nindriyas are drawn towards the vishays, that bhakta experiences \nextreme misery in his heart.  Therefore, only a person who gains \ncontrol over his indriyas remains eternally happy.  Furthermore, only \na person who has gained control over his indriyas should be known \nto have vairãgya and dharma.  A person who has not controlled his \nindriyas should not be known to possess vairãgya and dharma.  \nTherefore, since a person who has vairãgya and dharma has restraint \nover all of his indriyas, he is eternally happy.” \n \n8.4 \nThen, Muktãnand Swãmi said, “Mahãrãj, for a bhakta of Bhagvãn, \nwhat is the one greatest obstacle in his bhakti towards Bhagvãn?” \nGADHADÃ III \n- 698 - \n8.5 \nShreeji Mahãrãj replied, “For a bhakta of Bhagvãn, the greatest \nobstacles are that he does not realise his own faults, his mind \nbecomes distant from Bhagvãn and His bhaktas, and he develops a \nlack of concern towards the bhakta of Bhagvãn.  These are the \ngreatest obstacles for a bhakta.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 8 || 242 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 9 \nAwareness \n \n9.1 \nIn the Samvat year 1883, on Ãso sud 11 [11th October 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda outside the \nwest-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was \ndressed entirely in white clothes, and was wearing garlands around \nHis neck, and gajarã of flowers were tied around His arms.  Also, \ntassels of flowers were hanging from His pãgh.  A sabhã of munis, as \nwell as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n9.2 \nThen, Shreeji Mahãrãj said to all the bhaktas, “I shall now describe to \nall of you male and female bhaktas the sthiti and understanding of my \nsenior paramhans as it truly is.  After listening to this talk, I request \nall of you to narrate how you behave and to reveal your sthiti.” \n \n9.3 \nSaying this, Shreeji Mahãrãj began, “The senior sãdhus in my muni-\nmandal behave in such a way that the awareness within their hearts \nis the gateway to the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  It is at this gateway where all \nthe sãdhus remain standing.  Consider the following analogy:  A king’s \nguards, while standing at the entrance of the king’s palace, do not \nallow any thieves or robbers to come near the king.  They \ncourageously believe, ‘If anyone comes near the king to cause \nproblems, we will cut them to pieces, but in no way will we let them \nreach the king’.  With such courage, they wait, armed with shields and \nswords.  Similarly, all these sãdhus are standing at the gateway of the \ndhãm of Bhagvãn in the form of awareness. \nGADHADÃ III \n- 699 - \n9.4 \n“Inside that gateway of awareness (Akshardhãm) dwells Bhagvãn, of \nwhom they do darshan.  They do not allow wealth, women, or any \nother worldly objects to enter that murti of Bhagvãn in their heart.  If \nany worldly object does forcefully attempt to enter the heart, they \ndestroy that object, but in no way do they allow it to enter the \nlocation in their heart where they have secured Bhagvãn.  In this way, \nthey constantly remain alert like a brave warrior.  However, they do \nnot move from their position, regardless of whether they encounter \nprogress or regress, happiness or misery, praises or insults, or \ncountless other types of difficulties. \n \n9.5 \n“However, someone may doubt, ‘If they do not move from their \nposition, then how do they perform their bodily activities, such as \neating and drinking?’  I shall explain this using the following example:  \nConsider a woman who goes to a well to draw water.  She places her \nfeet on the edge of the well.  On the one hand, she remains cautious of \nthis, for fear that she will fall into the well.  However, her vrutti is also \nfixed upon drawing water from the well.  In another example, a man \nwho has mounted a horse is aware of his feet in the horse’s stirrups \nand is also aware of the reins in his hands.  While riding, he is also \naware of the trees, ditches, and stones that come along the path.  In \nthe same way, all these sãdhus, while keeping antar-drashti, remain \nin the sevã of Bhagvãn and also perform their bodily activities; but \nthey are not deflected from their sthiti.” \n \n9.6 \nShreeji Mahãrãj therefore revealed the sthiti of the senior sãdhus and \nthen said, “All of you should keep antar-drashti and constantly \nremain in the sevã of Bhagvãn.  Moreover, you should not allow \nobjects other than Bhagvãn to become dearer to you than Him.  All \nshould be extremely cautious of this. \n \n9.7 \n“After all, if a king’s guard is careless while guarding the king, thieves \nand robbers would reach the king, and the guard’s service would be \nrendered meaningless.  Similarly, if a bhakta develops love for the \nobjects other than Bhagvãn, then money, women, and other objects \nGADHADÃ III \n- 700 - \nalso enter his heart, in which lies the awareness of Bhagvãn.  Due to \nthis, his bhakti is rendered meaningless. \n \n9.8 \n“Therefore, a person who wishes to keep his bhakti free from \nobstacles and to attain the holy feet of Bhagvãn, should remain \nconstantly vigilant at the gateway of the dhãm of Bhagvãn in the form \nof awareness, and should not allow any objects except Bhagvãn to \nenter his heart.” \n \n9.9 \nIn this way, Shreeji Mahãrãj spoke words of wisdom for all of His \nbhaktas. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 9 || 243 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 10 \nVrundãvan And Kãshi \n \n10.1 In the Samvat year 1883, on Ãso vad 12 [28th October 1826], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda outside the \neast-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar's darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was \ndressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n10.2 In the sabhã, an educated brãhman of the Mãdhvi Sampradãy came to \nShreeji Mahãrãj.  Shreeji Mahãrãj asked him, “In the shãstras of your \nsampradãy, Vrundãvan is called the dhãm of Bhagvãn.  It is also said, \n‘Even at the time of final destruction, Vrundãvan is not destroyed’.  The \nfollowers of Shiv also claim, ‘At the time of final destruction, Kãshi is \nnot destroyed’.  But, I do not understand these statements.  This is \nbecause during final destruction, pruthvi, jal, tej, vãyu, and ãkãsh are \ncompletely destroyed, so how can Vrundãvan and Kãshi possibly \nremain?  If they do remain, how are they supported?  Such serious \ndoubts arise.” \n10.3 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked for the Shreemad Bhãgvat \nshãstras to be brought, and the narration of the four types of \nGADHADÃ III \n- 701 - \ndestruction (nitya-pralay, nimit-pralay, prãkrut-pralay, and ãtyantik-\npralay) from the eleventh and twelfth skandhs. \n \n10.4 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Looking from the viewpoint of the \nShreemad Bhãgvat and the Geetã, during final destruction, nothing \nremains of anything that has evolved from Prakruti and Purush.  So, if \nin final destruction Vrundãvan does remain intact, then please quote \na verse from the shãstras of Vyãsji or a verse from the Veds to prove \nit.  There is no greater ãchãrya than Vyãsji.  Others, who have become \nãchãryas and have established their sampradãys, have accepted the \nshãstras of Vyãsji as respected.  Therefore, the words of Vyãsji, the \ngreatest ãchãrya, are more respected than the words of all the other \nãchãryas.  So, using the words of Vyãsji and the verse of the Veds, \nverify the statement, ‘Vrundãvan is not destroyed in the final \ndestruction’.  Only then will my doubt be cleared. \n \n10.5 “Moreover, whoever has become an ãchãrya has established his \nbeliefs based on reference from the words of the Pãdma Purãn.  \nMostly, they have established these beliefs by inserting fictional \nverses into the Pãdma Purãn.  As a result, no one besides their own \nfollowers believes them.  Therefore, I will be convinced if you quote \nthe words of the popular Shreemad Bhãgvat Purãn.  This is because \nVyãsji had composed the Shreemad Bhãgvat after taking the essence \nof all the Veds, Purãns, and the historical shãstras.  Therefore, there is \nno Purãn as perfectly respected as the Shreemad Bhãgvat.  Also, the \nwhole of the Mahãbhãrat is not as respected as the Bhagvad Geetã.  \nTherefore, quote the words of such powerful shãstras to convince \nme.” \n \n10.6 After hearing these words of Shreeji Mahãrãj, the brãhman said, \n“Mahãrãj, the question you have raised is logical.  There is no one on \nthis earth capable of answering your question.  In my mind, I have \nformed a firm belief, ‘You are the ãchãrya of all ãchãryas, and the \nishvar of all ishvars’.  Therefore, please have compassion on me and \nexplain to me your principle.” \nGADHADÃ III \n- 702 - \n10.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “From the Veds, the Purãns, the historical \nshãstras, and the Smrutis, I have formed the belief that jeev, mãyã, \nishvar, Brahm, and Parbrahm are all eternal.  Consider it as follows:  \nMãyã represents the soil, the jeevs represent the seeds in the soil, and \nishvar, represents the rain.  By the will of Bhagvãn, an ishvar – in the \nform of Purush – unites with Mãyã.  As a result, just as the seeds in \nthe soil sprout by the association of rainwater, similarly, the jeevs, \nwhich are eternal, arise from within Mãyã; but new jeevs are not \ncreated.  Therefore, just as ishvar is eternal, Mãyã is eternal.  The \njeevs residing within Mãyã are also eternal, and they are not \ncomponents of Bhagvãn; they are always jeevs. \n \n10.8 “When a jeev seeks the refuge of Bhagvãn, it overcomes Bhagvãn’s \nMãyã, becomes brahm-rup like Nãrad and the Sanakãdik, attains the \ndhãm of Bhagvãn, and becomes His pãrshad.  This is my principle.” \n \n10.9 Hearing these words of Shreeji Mahãrãj, the brãhman abandoned his \nVaishnav beliefs, accepted Shreeji Mahãrãj’s refuge, and was initiated \ninto the Uddhav Sampradãy.    \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 10 || 244 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 11 \nUnderstanding Like That Of Sitãji \n \n11.1 In the Samvat year 1883, on Ashãdh sud 3 [27th June 1827], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on \nthe veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar's darbãr \nin Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of \nmunis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n11.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “I wish to ask the following question:  Is \nthere one method to overcome both the indriyas and the mind?  Or is \nGADHADÃ III \n- 703 - \nthe method to overcome the indriyas different from the means to \novercome the mind?  That is the question.” \n \n11.3 The senior paramhans replied according to their understanding, but \nthey were unable to give a precise answer. \n \n11.4 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj said Himself, “The answer is that the indriyas are \novercome by vairãgya, svadharma, tap, and niyams; and the mind is \novercome by the nine types of bhakti coupled with the knowledge of \nBhagvãn’s greatness.” \n \n11.5 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “How can the type of bliss that a \nbhakta of Bhagvãn enjoys in nirvikalp samãdhi be enjoyed even \nwithout samãdhi?” \n \n11.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If the bhakta has profound attachment and \ndeep love for Bhagvãn and His bhaktas, just like the attachment and \nlove that he has for his own body, then the type of bliss that prevails \nin nirvikalp samãdhi will continue to remain forever, even without \nthat samãdhi.  That is the only answer.” \n \n11.7 Then, \nShreeji \nMahãrãj \nasked \nparamhans, \n“What \ntype \nof \nunderstanding must a bhakta have, where he will in no way recede \nfrom the path of kalyãn regardless of the unpleasant circumstances \nhe may encounter, and where he develops such firmness that he will \nnot be affected by any obstacles whatsoever?” \n \n11.8 The senior sãdhus attempted to answer according to their \nunderstanding, but Shreeji Mahãrãj’s question was not completely \nanswered. \n \n11.9 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The answer to this is as follows:  If a person \nis profoundly attached to Bhagvãn and His bhaktas, just as he is \nattached to his body, then he will not be affected by any obstacles.  In \nGADHADÃ III \n- 704 - \nfact, regardless of the extent of unpleasant circumstances he may \nencounter, he will not turn away from Bhagvãn and His bhaktas.” \n \n11.10 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj addressed the paramhans again.  He said, \n“When Sitãji was exiled to the forest by Rãmchandraji, she felt great \nsorrow.  Lakshmanji was also very unhappy.  But then Sitãji \nexplained to Lakshmanji, ‘I am not crying because of my own grief; I \nam crying for the grief of Rãmchandraji.  He is extremely \ncompassionate, and since he has exiled me to the forest out of fear of \npublic accusation, he must be thinking, “I have sent Sitã to the forest \nwithout any fault of her own.”  Knowing this and being compassionate, \nhe must be experiencing severe grief in his mind.  So, please tell \nRãmchandraji, “Sitã is not distressed; she will go to Vãlmiki Rushi’s \nãshram and happily engage in your worship there.  So, do not feel any \nsorrow on account of Sitã’s distress.”  Please pass this message to \nRãmchandraji.  Sitãji sent this message with Lakshmanji, but in no \nway did she perceive faults in Rãmchandraji. \n \n11.11 “Now, one bhakta is such that he does not perceive faults in Bhagvãn \nand His bhaktas, but his vairãgya and dharma are moderate.  On the \nother hand, another bhakta has intense vairãgya and dharma, but \ndoes not have an understanding like that of Sitã.  Of these two types \nof bhaktas, which type should a person lovingly keep the company \nof?” \n \n11.12 Chaitanyãnand Swãmi replied, “A person should only keep the \ncompany – with intense love – of someone who has an understanding \nlike Sitãji, even though that person’s dharma and vairãgya may be \nmoderate.  He should not keep the company of someone, who \nperceives faults in Bhagvãn and His bhaktas, even though that person \nmay have intense vairãgya and dharma.” \n \n11.13 Hearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The answer is correct.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 11 || 245 || \nGADHADÃ III \n- 705 - \nGadhadã III – 12 \nPerceiving Avgun In Bhagvãn And His Sant \n \n12.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Ashãdh vad 8 [16th July 1827], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in the balcony of the medi of \nHis residence in Dãdã Khãchar's darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n12.2 Then, for the benefit of His bhaktas, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A person \nwho desires his own kalyãn should not have any form of pride, such \nas, ‘I have been born in an upper-class family’, or ‘I am wealthy’, or ‘I \nam handsome’, or ‘I am a scholar’.  He should not keep any of these \nbeliefs.  In fact, even with a humble satsangi, he should behave as a \ndãs of a dãs. \n \n12.3 “Furthermore, even though he may be called a satsangi, a person who \nhas perceived avgun in Bhagvãn or His bhaktas should be known to \nbe like a rabid dog.  Just as a person who is touched by the saliva of a \nrabid dog also become rabid, similarly, if a person listens to the talks \nof or keeps affection for someone who has perceived avgun in \nBhagvãn or His bhaktas, then both the person who keeps the \naffection and the listener become like a vimukh.  Then, just as \ntuberculosis is never cured by any medicine, similarly, the demonic \nattitude of a person who has perceived avgun in Bhagvãn or His \nbhaktas is never eradicated from his heart.  On the other hand, a \nperson who may have killed countless brãhmans; or may have killed \ncountless children; or may have killed countless women; or may have \nkilled countless cows; or may have even associated many times with \nthe wife of his guru, can be freed from these sins at some time or \nother.  In fact, the shãstras even describe the methods to do so.  \nHowever, no shãstra describes methods to be released from the sin of \nperceiving avgun in Bhagvãn or His bhaktas.  If a person consumes \npoison, or falls into the ocean, or falls from a mountain, or is eaten by \nGADHADÃ III \n- 706 - \na demon, then he has to die only once.  However, a person who \ninsults Bhagvãn or His bhaktas has to continuously die and be reborn \nfor countless millions of years. \n \n12.4 “At most, a disease leads to the death of the body; or an enemy \ndestroys the body; but, the jeev is not destroyed.  However, by \ninsulting Bhagvãn or His bhaktas, the jeev is also destroyed.  Someone \nmay ask, ‘How can the jeev be destroyed?’  Well, for example, a \nhermaphrodite cannot be called a man or a woman, he can only be \ncalled impotent.  Similarly, the jeev of a person who insults Bhagvãn \nor His bhaktas also becomes impotent; the jeev is never able to make \nan effort for his own kalyãn.  Therefore, his jeev should be known as \nhaving been destroyed.  Knowing this, a person should never insult \nBhagvãn or His bhaktas. \n \n12.5 “In addition, a person should not have deep affection for his bodily \nrelations, even if they happen to be satsangis.  For example, if a \nsnake’s venom falls into some sweetened milk, then whoever drinks \nit will die.  In the same way, even if a person’s bodily relations are \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn, they are still mixed with venom (relationships).  \nTherefore, a person who has affection for them will definitely \nsacrifice his kalyãn.  Knowing this, a person who wishes for his own \nkalyãn should not maintain affection for his bodily relations.  In this \nway, after becoming detached from worldly life and having love for \nthe holy feet of Bhagvãn, a person should continue to engage in the \nworship of Bhagvãn. \n \n12.6 “A person who retains the talk that I have just delivered within his \nheart, will never encounter obstacles on the path of kalyãn.  In fact, \nthis talk is like a miraculous technique.” \n \n12.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj concluded the talk with these words. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 12 || 246 || \nGADHADÃ III \n- 707 - \nGadhadã III – 13 \nThe Wish Of Bhagvãn Is Our Prãrabdha \n \n13.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Ashãdh vad 9 [17th July 1827], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda outside the \neast-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was \ndressed entirely in white clothes.  Garlands of mogrã flowers were \nhanging around His neck, and tassels decorated His pãgh.  A sabhã of \nmunis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him.  Some of the munis were singing kirtans to the \naccompaniment of a dukad and sarodã.  \n \n13.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please stop singing the kirtans, and let us \ntalk about Bhagvãn.”  Shreeji Mahãrãj asked a question to the muni-\nmandal:  “A jeev’s body is dependent upon the karmas performed in \npast lives.  That is why it is not always so stable.  For example, \nsometimes a person remains healthy, and sometimes he becomes ill; \nsometimes he functions independently, and sometimes he becomes \ndependent, where he may or may not be able to stay where he \nchooses; and sometimes he may be able to stay in the company of \nbhaktas, but sometimes he may even be separated from them and be \nforced to live alone.  All of this is due to the influence of karma or kãl.  \nIn such circumstance, a person’s determination in observing niyams \nbecomes unsteady. \n \n13.3 “Further, if a ruler like the British detains a person; or if a person’s \nmind and indriyas – which are also like the British rulers – keep him \nunder their control, then it is uncertain whether he will stay in the \ncompany of sãdhus or follow the niyams of satsang.  Having said this, \nthe shãstras have specifically stated: ‘If a person perfectly possesses all \nfour of the qualities of dharma, gnãn, vairãgya, and bhakti, then he can \nbe called an ekãntik bhakta, and such a person attains ultimate \nkalyãn’.  Also, it seems unlikely that the physical conditions will \nremain stable under the influence of Kãl and karma.  Therefore, how \nGADHADÃ III \n- 708 - \ncan a bhakta of Bhagvãn maintain his ekãntik state?  That is the \nquestion.” \n \n13.4 Then, Gopãlãnand Swãmi, Chaitanyãnand Swãmi, Nityãnand Swãmi, \nMuktãnand Swãmi, Brahmãnand Swãmi, Shuk Muni, and other senior \nsãdhus answered according to whatever they felt was correct but \nwere unable to answer the question satisfactorily.   \n \n13.5  Shreeji Mahãrãj then said in reply, “Please listen as I reveal to you \nthe way in which my belief of Bhagvãn remains firms.”  He then \nbegan, “Regardless of how much pain or pleasure comes my way, and \nregardless of whether wealth or poverty comes my way, in those \ncircumstances, first I realise the immense greatness of Bhagvãn.  On \nseeing the riches and royal wealth of the great kings of this world, it \nis this understanding that allows me to not associate even the \nslightest amount of significance to them in my heart.  I believe that \nfor me, there is nothing greater than Bhagvãn; and so my mind is \nfirmly attached to His holy feet.  In fact, my love for Bhagvãn is so \nfirm that even Kãl, karma, and Mãyã are incapable of destroying that \nlove.  Even if my own mind attempts to destroy that love for Bhagvãn, \nit cannot be destroyed.  In fact, my love is such that regardless of the \nextent of happiness or misery that may happen to come my way, the \nlove is not destroyed. \n \n13.6 “Also, the natural inclination of my mind is such that I do not at all \nprefer to live in cities, in mansions or in royal palaces.  On the \ncontrary, I very much prefer to stay where there are forests, \nmountains, rivers, trees, or in some secluded place.  I feel that it \nwould be nice to sit alone in some secluded place and perform dhyãn \nupon Bhagvãn.  That is what I prefer at all times.  In fact, before I had \nthe darshan of Rãmãnand Swãmi, I had already decided with \nMuktãnand Swãmi, ‘After you arrange for me to have the darshan of \nRãmãnand Swãmi, the two of us will retire to the forest and constantly \nengage ourselves in the dhyãn of Bhagvãn, and never shall we return to \nGADHADÃ III \n- 709 - \nstay amongst people’.  Such was the determination in my mind then; \neven now, I feel exactly the same. \n \n13.7 “In addition, the profound love that I have for Bhagvãn and His \nbhaktas is so strong that even Kãl, karma, and Mãyã are incapable of \neradicating that love.  In fact, even if my own mind attempted to \neradicate it, it would definitely not be eradicated from my heart.  \nSuch is the intense love I have for Bhagvãn and His bhaktas. \n \n13.8 “Many times I have become disheartened and felt like leaving this \nsatsang, but I have remained here on seeing the bhaktas; I could in no \nway abandon them and leave.  In fact, I would be unable to stay \nwhere I do not find such bhaktas of Bhagvãn, even if someone were \nto try by a million methods to keep me there.  Regardless of how well \na person may serve me, I simply cannot get along with someone who \nis not a bhakta of Bhagvãn.  In this way, I have attached my mind with \nprofound love to Bhagvãn and His bhaktas; and other than that \nBhagvãn, I have no liking for anything else.  If that is so, why should \nlove for Bhagvãn not remain?  When I am engaged in kathãs or \nkirtans related to Bhagvãn, I experience such happiness that I feel as \nif I shall become mad due to it.  In fact, whatever calmness remains is \nsolely for the benefit of the bhaktas; but in the mind, the very same \nhappiness always remains; although outwardly, I behave in \naccordance with the customs of society. \n \n13.9 “It is that very Bhagvãn who is the sole controller of this body.  If He \nwishes, He may seat him on an elephant; or if He wishes, He may \nhave it thrown in prison; or if He so wishes, He may even place some \nserious illness in the body.  Despite this, a person should never pray \nbefore Bhagvãn in the following way:  ‘Mahãrãj!  Please relieve me of \nmy misery’.  This is because we want this body to behave in \naccordance with the wishes of Bhagvãn; after all, Bhagvãn’s wish is \nour wish.  We do not want our preferences to differ from the \npreferences of Bhagvãn even in the slightest way.  Moreover, since \nwe have offered our body, mind, and wealth to Bhagvãn, then only \nGADHADÃ III \n- 710 - \nthe wish of Bhagvãn is our prãrabdha; besides that, there is no other \nprãrabdha for us.  Therefore, regardless of whatever pain or pleasure \nwe may encounter by the wish of Bhagvãn, we should not become \ndisturbed in any way; we should be pleased with whatever pleases \nBhagvãn. \n \n13.10 “Therefore, Bhagvãn Himself protects the dharma, gnãn, vairãgya, \nand bhakti of a bhakta who has such intense love for Bhagvãn.  \nOccasionally, due to the prevalence of unpleasant circumstances, it \nmay outwardly appear that such a bhakta is disobeying dharma, \ngnãn, vairãgya, and bhakti, but inwardly, there is no disobedience at \nall.” \n \n13.11 In this way, by quoting His own example, Shreeji Mahãrãj described \nthe understanding of an extremely firm bhakta of Bhagvãn, and how \nhe should develop firm love for Bhagvãn. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 13 || 247 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 14 \nLove And Faith \nThe Kãyasth’s Unworthy Desire \n \n14.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Ashãdh vad 11 [19th July 1827], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda outside the \neast-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was \ndressed entirely in white clothes.  Tassels of flowers were hanging \nfrom the pãgh upon His head, and garlands of flowers were hanging \naround His neck.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him.  Some munis were singing \nkirtans. \n \n14.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please stop the singing and begin a \nquestion-answer discussion.” \n \nGADHADÃ III \n- 711 - \n14.3 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked with folded hands “Mahãrãj, there is \nnothing more essential than Bhagvãn; yet why does an individual not \ndevelop deep love for Him?  That is the question.”  \n \n14.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “He has no wisdom.  If he did have wisdom, \nhe would think, ‘I have accepted the vow of brahm-chãrya, yet the \ndesire to enjoy the pleasures of women still has not disappeared from \nmy heart.  That is very improper as I have invariably enjoyed the \npleasures of women when I have taken birth in the 8.4 million life forms \n– and those pleasures have always been much greater than those \nexperienced in a human birth’.  When this jeev was born as a goat, it \nmust have single-handedly indulged in the pleasures of a thousand \nfemale goats.  When it took birth as a horse, or a bull, or a buffalo, or \na king monkey, or indeed any other animal, it must have encountered \ncountless young, beautiful females of its own species.  This was not \ndue to prãrabdha, nor was it due to Bhagvãn’s grace – it was only \nnatural.  Moreover, if a person does not worship Bhagvãn, he will \nobtain countless females in whichever life-form he is born in.  This \nwould not be due to the sevã or pujã of some dev, or to the chanting of \nsome mantra; as the opportunity of enjoying women and other \npleasures is natural.   \n \n14.5 This jeev has become a dev several times, where it has enjoyed the \npleasures of Dev-Lok; many times it has become an emperor of the \nworld and enjoyed countless pleasures on this earth.  Despites this, \nthe jeev’s craving to enjoy women and other objects has still not \ndiminished.  Instead, a person feels that the pleasures of women and \nother objects are extremely rare and, realising their immense \npleasure, develops affection for them.  That affection is such that it \ncan in no way be eradicated, however much a person tries.  It is \nbecause of this sin that the jeev is unable to develop deep love for \nBhagvãn. \n \n14.5 “I have personally seen with my own eyes how the jeev has such \nimpure, worldly desires.  When I was young, I used to go to a mandir \nGADHADÃ III \n- 712 - \nof Shiv in Ayodhyã and sleep there.  One day, a Kãyasth came to offer \npujã to Shiv and ask for the following vardãn:  ‘O Mahãrãj!  O Shivji!  \nNever grant me a human birth again.  In this human birth, I have taken \nso many aphrodisiacs, yet I have been unable to fully enjoy the \npleasures of women to my satisfaction.  Therefore, O Shivji!  Please \ngrant me the body of a donkey for many lives to come so that I can fully \nenjoy the pleasures of females without shame or restrictions’.  He asked \nfor this vardãn from Shivji daily.  So, because of this sin of harbouring \nworldly desires, the jeev does not develop love for Bhagvãn in any \nway.” \n \n14.6 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked further, “Mahãrãj, a person who does \nnot have wisdom does not develop love for Bhagvãn.  But, what about \nsomeone who believes that Bhagvãn is the ocean of all bliss, and that \nall objects other than Bhagvãn are certainly full of only misery?  \nDespite knowing this, why does he not develop love for Bhagvãn?” \n \n14.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “In either a past life or in this present life, \nthat person has been influenced by extremely unpleasant desh, kãl, \nkriyã, and sang.  Due to this, he has performed very intense, sinful \nkarmas that have left impressions on his mind.  Therefore, despite \nbeing able to discriminate between good and bad, he is unable to \navoid the bad and develop deep love for Bhagvãn.  Moreover, just as \nthe influence of unpleasant desh, kãl, kriyã, and sang causes the \nimpressions of sinful karmas to influence the mind, similarly, the \ninfluence of extremely pleasant desh, kãl, kriyã, and sang causes a \nperson to perform very intense, pure karmas.  The influence of these \npure karmas will destroy the very intense, sinful karmas.  Only then \ndoes a person develop deep love for Bhagvãn.  That is the answer to \nthe question.” \n \n14.8 Then, Ayodhyãprasãdji asked, “Suppose there is a person who is very \nintelligent, and whose knowledge of the shãstras is also exceptional.  \nOn the other hand, there is a person who is not so intelligent and who \nhas a limited understanding of the shãstras.  Nevertheless, the person \nGADHADÃ III \n- 713 - \nwho is very intelligent falls from satsang, whereas a person who is \nnot intelligent remains firm in satsang.  What is the reason for this?” \n \n14.9 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “There are two types of people in this \nworld:  religious and demonic.  Of these, those who are demonic will \nfall from satsang, despite being exceptionally intelligent; whereas \nthose who are religious will never fall from satsang, even though they \nmay not be intelligent.  For example, if a person sows a seed of chilli \nor the seed of a neem tree or the seed of a shingadiyo vachhnãg plant \nand he waters them daily with sweet water, the chillies will still turn \nout to be spicy; the neem tree will still be bitter; and the shingadiyo \nvachhnãg plant will still be poisonous.  This is because that is the \nnature of the seeds themselves.  On the other hand, if a person sows \nsugarcane, the juice of the sugarcane will still be sweet despite \ntreating it with compost from leaves of a neem tree and watering it \nwith bitter water.  In the same way, religious people will always stay \non the path of Bhagvãn, and demonic people will always turn away \nfrom the path of Bhagvãn.” \n \n14.10 Then, Shuk Muni asked, “How can a person distinguish between a \nreligious person and a demonic person?” \n \n14.11 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “In a religious person, vicious natures such \nas kãm, krodh, and lobh, are due to the influence of unpleasant \ncircumstances.  However, they are destroyed within a short time \nunder the influence of pleasant circumstances.  On the other hand, in \na demonic person, vicious natures such as kãm, krodh, and lobh, are \nnever destroyed.  If someone were to speak some harsh words to a \ndemonic person even once, he would not forget them for as long as \nhe lives.  Then, if that demonic person were to become a satsangi, he \nwould initially appear to be better than all the other bhaktas.  But, he \nwould be like silt that has gathered in the region of Bhãl – where \nthere was previously sea – has made the soil fertile.  As long as the \nsilt remains, sweet water can be obtained by digging below; but, if a \nperson were to dig much deeper, then extremely saline water would \nGADHADÃ III \n- 714 - \nemerge.  In the same way, even if a demonic person has become a \nbhakta of Bhagvãn, the moment his wishes are not fulfilled and he is \neven slightly disturbed, then compared to the sevã of the sãdhus he \nhad previously performed, he would insult them thousands of times \nmore.  Even then, his mind would not be happy.” \n \n14.12 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “Mahãrãj, you said that a demonic \nperson who becomes a bhakta will remain in satsang as long as his \nwishes are fulfilled; and if they are not fulfilled, he falls from satsang.  \nBut, what if he happens to die before falling from satsang?  Will he \nremain demonic, or will he become religious?” \n \n14.13 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “As long as the demonic person is good when \nhe encounters death, and he offers bhakti to Bhagvãn, he will become \nreligious and will attain Akshardhãm.” \n \n14.14 Then, Nrusinhãnand Swãmi asked, “Of the nine types of bhakti, which \nis the best?” \n \n14.15 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Of the nine types of bhakti, whichever type \nhelps a person in developing firm attachment to Bhagvãn is the best \ntype of bhakti for that particular person.” \n \n14.16 Then, Gopãlãnand Swãmi asked, “During childhood or during youth, \nwhat type of company should a person seek?” \n \n14.17 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “Both should lovingly keep the company \nof a person who is senior in age, is firm in dharma, gnãn, and \nvairãgya; and has deep love for Bhagvãn.” \n \n14.18 Then Nãjã Jogiyã asked, “Which is the best of the three:  a person \nwhose mind is attached to Bhagvãn out of anger, a person whose \nmind is attached to Bhagvãn out of fear, or a person whose mind is \nattached to Bhagvãn out of love?” \nGADHADÃ III \n- 715 - \n14.19 Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A person whose mind is attached to Bhagvãn \nout of love is the best.” \n \n14.20 Then, Shivãnand Swãmi asked, “How can a bhakta of Bhagvãn who \ndoes not possess wisdom of what is good and bad as described by \nShreeji Mahãrãj, and who also lacks vairãgya, develop such wisdom, \nand also develop vairãgya towards all objects other than Bhagvãn?” \n \n14.21 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If a person develops firm love for Bhagvãn \nfrom the initial stages, then due to that love, wisdom and vairãgya \nwill automatically develop.  Now, consider the following:  When a \nperson is attached to an object, it is called affection or desire.  Then, if \nsomeone were to obstruct the gaining of any object for which he has \naffection, he would become angry on that person.  This applies not \nonly to humans; even animals express such anger.  For example, due \nto lust, a buffalo that is attached to a female buffalo will kill another \nbuffalo that approaches the female; this behaviour is widely observed \nin all types of animals.  In the same way, a person with deep love for \nBhagvãn immediately becomes angry on any object that acts as an \nobstruction in that love and he immediately abandons that object.  \nTherefore, a person who has deep love for Bhagvãn automatically \ndevelops vairãgya as well as wisdom.” \n \n14.22 Again, Shivãnand Swãmi asked, “Suppose there are two types of \npeople, both of whom are intelligent.  Of these, one possesses faith \nand accepts whatever Bhagvãn says; whereas the other accepts only \nthose words of Bhagvãn that he feels are appropriate.  Of the two, \nwho is better?” \n \n14.23 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Only the person who possesses faith is \nbetter.  Rãmchandraji has said in the Rãmãyan, ‘I protect a person \nwho has firm faith in me – just as a mother protects her child’.  \nTherefore, only the person with faith is better.” \n \n14.24 Then, Ãtmãnand Swãmi asked, “In a person’s mind, he is determined \nto behave according to the wishes of Bhagvãn for the rest of his life.  \nGADHADÃ III \n- 716 - \nHowever, he still feels, ‘What can a person do for Bhagvãn and His \nsant to earn their trust?’” \n \n14.25 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “Firstly, a person earns the trust of \nBhagvãn and His sant when he does not have hatred towards anyone \nand does not feel disheartened, even if he falls severely ill and is not \ncared for very well during that illness.  Secondly, even if he is harshly \ninsulted by Bhagvãn and His sant without any fault of his own, he still \ndoes not have hatred towards anyone.  Thirdly, if he were to even \nslightly disobey his observance of the niyams of this satsang, he \nwould feel extremely apologetic and would immediately perform \nprãyshchit.  Also, even if he were to entertain an evil thought in his \nmind, he would feel just as apologetic and distressed as someone \nwho had happened to physically disobey the observance of the \nniyams.  A person with these characteristics earns the complete trust \nof Bhagvãn and His sant, and they feel, ‘This person will never fall back \nfrom satsang’.” \n \n14.26 Then, Bhagvadãnand Swãmi asked, “How can others recognise a \nbhakta who continuously understands the greatness of Bhagvãn and \nHis bhaktas in his mind?” \n \n14.27 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “A person who continuously understands \nthe greatness of Bhagvãn and His bhaktas in his mind serves them \nsincerely and lovingly.  He physically bows and touches the feet of all \nthe sãdhus.  If a sãdhu were to fall ill, he would massage his head and \nfeet and also take care of his dietary needs.  If he were to receive \nsome object that he liked, he would first offer it to the sãdhus before \nusing it for himself.  A person, who behaves in this way by thought, \nword, and deed, should be known to have fully understood the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn and His sant within his heart.” \n \n14.28 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked the sãdhus a question:  “A person may \npossess intense dharma, gnãn, vairãgya, and bhakti.  However \nsometimes, there may be some relaxation in his observance of \nGADHADÃ III \n- 717 - \ndharma; there may be some attachment despite having vairãgya; \nthere may be some reduction in his bhakti; and attachment to his \nbody may still remain despite having gnãn.  What can be the reason \nfor this?” \n \n14.29 Gopãlãnand Swãmi and Brahmãnand Swãmi replied, “If there \nappears to be a flaw in a person who possesses intense dharma, gnãn, \nvairãgya, and bhakti – a person who can be thought of as being as \npowerful as Bhagvãn Himself – it remains purely out of compassion; \nit is not a flaw.  In fact, when such a great person behaves with bãhya-\ndrashti, he transforms many jeevs to the ranks of Jadbharat and \nShukji.  Therefore, such an extremely great person behaves in a \nworldly way purely out of compassion for the jeevs.” \n \n14.30 Hearing their reply, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “That is precisely the \ncorrect answer to the question.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 14 || 248 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 15 \nApplying Bandages To Wounds \n \n15.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Ashãdh vad 13 [21st July 1827], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in the balcony of the medi of \nHis residence in Dãdã Khãchar's darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes and was also wearing garlands of mogrã \nflowers around His neck.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n15.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said to Muktãnand Swãmi, “Today, I had a long \ntalk with the bhaktas (Jeevu-Bã and Lãdu-Bã) who cook for me.” \n \n15.3 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, what did you talk about?” \nGADHADÃ III \n- 718 - \n15.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “The talk was that when a bhakta of \nBhagvãn sits to perform the mãnsi pujã of Bhagvãn or sits to perform \ndhyãn upon Bhagvãn, he remembers the times in the past when his \njeev has surrendered to the panch-vishays due to the influence of \nunpleasant circumstances or the influence of vicious natures.  For \nexample, a warrior who returns injured from the battlefield rests on \na bedstead due to his wound.  However, until his wounds are not \ndressed with bandages, the pain of the wounds does not decrease \nand he is not able to sleep.  Only when bandages are applied to his \nwounds is he relieved of his pain and only then is he able to sleep.  In \nthe same way, the jeev has been ‘wounded’ by the panch-vishays due \nto the influence of unpleasant desh, kãl, kriyã, and sang.  Whichever of \nthe nine types of bhakti relieves the pain of these ‘wounds’ caused by \nthe vishays and makes a person unaware of the vishays themselves, \nshould be thought of as the application of a bandage to the ‘wounds’.  \nAlso, that particular type of bhakti should be known to be his \nstrength in worshipping Bhagvãn. \n \n15.5 “Then, abiding by that particular strength, a person should engage in \nmãnsi pujã or the mental chanting of Bhagvãn’s name.  In fact, \nwhatever he may do, he should do so within his own particular \nstrength.  He will benefit tremendously as a result of this. \n \n15.6 “However, just as a wounded warrior experiences no peace until his \nwounds are bandaged, similarly, if a person fails to recognise his own \nparticular strength, he will not experience any happiness at all during \nbhajan and smaran, and the pain due to the ‘wounds’ caused by the \nvishays will not be relieved.  Therefore, after recognising which of the \nnine types of bhakti cause his mind to be fixed on Bhagvãn and \nprevents him from indulging in any thoughts other than those of \nBhagvãn, that bhakta should realise, ‘This is my particular strength’.  \nThen, he should keep that type of bhakti predominant.  This method \nis a universal principle.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 15 || 249 || \nGADHADÃ III \n- 719 - \nGadhadã III – 16 \nBhakti Like A Pati Vratã \n \n16.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Ashãdh vad Amãs [23rd July 1827], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda \noutside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  \nHe was dressed entirely in white clothes.  He was wearing garlands of \nmogrã flowers around His neck, and extremely beautiful tassels were \nhanging from His pãgh.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from \nvarious places, had gathered before Him. \n \n16.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “I ask a question to the entire muni-\nmandal and to all the grahastha bhaktas; whoever can reply may do \nso.  The question is as follows:  It does not take very long for a bhakta \nof Bhagvãn to avoid the company of a person who is full of avgun.  \nBut, how is it possible to avoid the company of a person with \nextremely noble gun?  After all, a person naturally develops affection \nfor a person with gun, regardless of whether he is a relative or not.  \nMoreover, affection that is formed, due to the influence of those gun, \ncannot be eradicated, however much a person tries.  Therefore, how \ndoes a bhakta of Bhagvãn prevent the development of affection for \nanyone other than Bhagvãn, regardless of the gun of that person?  \nThat is the question.” \n \n16.3 The senior sãdhus replied according to their understanding, but were \nunable to answer Shreeji Mahãrãj’s question. \n \n16.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Allow me to answer.  The answer is as \nfollows:  A pati vratã is not even slightly impressed in her mind on \nseeing other rich, handsome, or young men, even if her husband is \npoor, ugly, ill, or old.  If she does happen to affectionately look at or \nlaugh with other men, then she breaks her pati vratã vow.  If some \nguests were to come to the house of that pati vratã, she would offer \nthem food and water.  If she offers food and water to some male \nGADHADÃ III \n- 720 - \nrelative of her husband, she does so knowing him to be related to her \nhusband, but the affection she has for all other men does not even \ncome close to the love she has for her husband; nor does she see gun \nin other men as she sees in her own husband.  Moreover, she acts \naccording to the wishes of her own husband.  Such is the firm fidelity \nthat a pati vratã wife has towards her husband. \n \n16.5 “In the same way, a bhakta should have firm loyalty to Bhagvãn.  \nSpecifically, like a woman who is a pati vratã, he would never \ndevelop the same love towards even other mukta sãdhus – however \ngreat they may be – as he has developed towards whichever murti of \nBhagvãn he has had the darshan of.  He does not develop love for \nother avatãrs of his ishta-dev.  He keeps love only for the murti that \nhe has attained, and he acts according to His wishes only.  If he does \nhappen to respect others, it is only because of their association with \nhis Bhagvãn.  A person who has such faithful bhakti towards his own \nishta-dev, never develops affection on seeing others, even though he \nmay have many gun.  \n \n16.6 “For example, Hanumãnji is a bhakta of Shree Rãmchandraji.  \nFollowing the avatãr of Rãm, there have been many other avatãrs of \nBhagvãn, but Hanumãnji’s bhakti has been like that of a woman who \nobserves the vow of fidelity, as he has remained faithful to only \nRãmchandraji.  This is why Hanumãnji’s bhakti is considered to be \nlike that of a pati vratã.  The bhakti of a bhakta of Bhagvãn who has \nsuch fidelity can be said to be like that of a pati vratã.  Conversely, if a \nperson does not have fidelity, his bhakti can be said to be like that of \na prostitute.  Therefore, a person should not knowingly engage in \nbhakti that would cause him to be disgraced.  Instead, a bhakta of \nBhagvãn should thoughtfully engage in faithful bhakti – like that of a \npati vratã.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 16 || 250 || \n \nGADHADÃ III \n- 721 - \nGadhadã III – 17 \nThe Story Of Bharatji \n \n17.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Shrãvan sud 6 [30th July 1827], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was sitting on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of \nDãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes and was wearing garlands of flowers around His neck.  A \nsabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \n17.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “There is no story in the Shreemad \nBhãgvat as incredible as the story of Bharatji.  This is because \nBharatji was the son of Rushabh-Dev Bhagvãn, and for the specific \npurpose of realising Bhagvãn, he gave up his kingdom, which \nconsisted of the whole world, and retired to the forest.  Then, while \nengaged in the worship of Bhagvãn, he developed affection for a \nyoung deer.  As a result, his mind’s vrutti took the form of that deer.  \nAs a result, despite his greatness, Bharatji was reborn as a deer due \nto the sin of that attachment. \n \n17.3 “As a matter of fact, there are countless types of sins; but for a bhakta \nof Bhagvãn, of all those sins, having affection for anything except \nBhagvãn is an extremely great sin.  Therefore, if a wise person thinks \nover this story of Bharatji, he becomes extremely fearful in his heart \nwith the thought, ‘What if I develop affection for anything other than \nBhagvãn?’  In this way, he becomes extremely afraid. \n \n17.4 “Then, when Bharatji gave up the body of the deer, he was born in a \nbrãhman family.  Then, out of fear of developing affection for \nanything other than Bhagvãn, he paid no attention at all to worldly \naffairs and deliberately behaved as a madman.  He lived in a way \nwhere he could maintain his vrutti constantly on Bhagvãn.” \n \n17.5 After delivering this talk, Shreeji Mahãrãj left to attend the ãrti. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 17 || 251 || \nGADHADÃ III \n- 722 - \nGadhadã III – 18 \nWorldly Desires Become Old \n \n18.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Shrãvan vad 10 [17th August 1827], \nShreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda outside the east-facing \nrooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.

After all, the same types of worldly \ndesire, which appear while awake, spring forth in dreams as well.” \n \n18.4 Then, Nirlobhãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, many times, objects that \nhave never been seen or heard in the jãgrat state, spring forth in \ndreams.  What may be the reason for this?” \n \n18.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “If objects that have never been \npreviously seen or heard appear in the svapna state, it is due to \nembedded desires created by karmas performed in past lives.” \n \n18.6 Then, Akhandãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, for a person who \nbecomes a bhakta of Bhagvãn, how long does the force of karmas \nperformed in past lives remain?” \n \n18.7 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “When that person comes into contact \nwith a sat-purush, the embedded desires created by his past karmas \ngradually wear away as he consistently associates with him.  \nEventually, he reaches a stage where the desires that give rise to \nGADHADÃ III \n- 723 - \nbirths and deaths no longer remain.  For example, grains of rice that \nare three to four years old can be eaten; but if they are sown, they \nwould not grow.  In the same way, when the embedded desires \ngenerated by the previously performed karmas degenerate, they do \nnot lead to further births and deaths. \n \n18.8 “However, a person may ask, ‘How does a person recognise whether \nthose embedded desires have degenerated or not?’  Well, consider the \nanalogy of a contest between two men armed with shields and \nswords.  As long as both can withstand each other, the strength of \nboth appears to be equal.  But, the moment a person draws back, he \nis said to have been defeated.  Similarly, for a bhakta of Bhagvãn, as \nlong as thoughts related to Bhagvãn and the thoughts related to the \nvishays appear to be equal, he should realise his worldly desires to be \nmore powerful.  However, when thoughts related to Bhagvãn \ndisplace those related to the vishays, he should realise that his \nworldly desires have reduced.” \n \n18.9 Shreeji Mahãrãj then asked the paramhans a question:  “How can a \nbhakta, who no longer identifies himself with the body and who has \ndeveloped hatred for the panch-vishays, be recognised by other \nbhaktas?” \n \n18.10 Muktãnand Swãmi replied, “Mahãrãj, we are incapable of answering \nyour question.  Please be compassionate and answer it yourself.” \n \n18.11 So, Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Whether he is a grahastha or a tyãgi, a \nbhakta of Bhagvãn who no longer believes himself to be the body and \nwhose attachment for the panch-vishays has been eradicated, may be \nrequired to behave as if he is the body depending on Bhagvãn’s \ninstructions to him; he may also have to indulge in the panch-vishays \nif necessary.  For example, a frail bull can be made to stand with the \nsupport of a stick and by people holding it by its horn and tail.  But, it \nwill remain standing only as long as someone holds it up; the \nmoment it is released, it will fall to the ground.  Similarly, a person \nGADHADÃ III \n- 724 - \nwho is free of worldly desires engages in activities only to the extent \nof the instructions given by Bhagvãn. \n \n18.12 In another example, take a person with a bow and arrow in hand.  \nThe bow bends as the person pulls back the string; when he releases \nthe arrow, the bow becomes slack again.  In the same way, a person \nfree of worldly desires engages himself in activities only to the extent \nof Bhagvãn’s wish, but never does he do anything which disobeys \nthat.  On the other hand, when a person with worldly desires engages \nin activities, he is unable to detach himself from those activities of his \nown accord; he is unable to do so even when Bhagvãn instructs him.  \nThese are the characteristics of a person free of worldly desires and a \nperson with worldly desires.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã III || 18 || 252 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 19 \nTwo Undesirable Traits Of A Tyãgi \n \n19.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Shrãvan vad 13 [20th August 1827], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on \nthe veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr \nin Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  Also, garlands \nof mogrã and karnikãr were hanging around His neck.  A sabhã of \nmunis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n19.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A bhakta who has abandoned worldly \nlife may possess two negative traits which are not appropriate for \nhim in this satsang; the first is lust and the second is affection for his \nrelatives.  In my eyes, a person who possesses these two negative \ntraits is like an animal.  Of these two, I have an extreme repulsion for \na person who has excessive affection for his relatives. \nGADHADÃ III \n- 725 - \n19.3 “For this reason, a person who has abandoned worldly life should not \nkeep even the slightest amount of affection for his relatives.  This is \nbecause having affection for bodily relatives is a greater sin than the \nfive great sins.  Therefore, a tyãgi bhakta of Bhagvãn should realise \nhis own chaitanya to be distinct from both the body and the relatives \nof the body.  He should believe, ‘I am the ãtmã; I have no relations at \nall with anyone’.  In fact, the relatives of this body should be \nconsidered together with the relatives of the 8.4 million types of \nprevious life forms.  If a person does try to understand the greatness \nof his relatives, knowing them to be satsangis, then since there is \nalready some affection due to the fact that they are related, he \ndevelops more affection for them than he has for Bhagvãn and the \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn.  Therefore, if a person does keep affection for his \nrelatives knowing them to be bhaktas of Bhagvãn, towards whom \naffection is natural, then his life becomes useless. \n \n19.4 “Moreover, it is also natural for a person to develop affection for \nthose who perform his sevã, even though they may not be his \nrelatives.  So, a person who is wise should not keep affection towards \na person who is serving him, even if that person happens to be a \nbhakta of Bhagvãn.  For example, if a snake has released venom into \nsweetened milk, the mixture also becomes poisonous.  Similarly, out \nof self-interest, a person should not keep affection towards someone \nwho performs his sevã, even if the person serving happens to be a \nbhakta.  This is because his jeev becomes attached due to that sevã.  \nThen, just as he thinks about Bhagvãn, he also begins to think about \nthe person who serves his needs.  For that person, this in itself is an \nobstacle in his worship of Bhagvãn – just as the young deer itself \nbecomes avidyã (mãyã) for Bharatji.  In this way, a bhakta of Bhagvãn \nshould totally avoid all those who obstruct his worship of Bhagvãn, \nknowing them to be avidyã.” \n \n19.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj then concluded by adding, “The paramhans and all \nthe sãnkhya-yogi bhaktas should daily say and listen to this talk \nwhich I have just delivered.  Specifically, the senior member of a \nGADHADÃ III \n- 726 - \nmandal should daily narrate this talk, and others should listen.  If the \nsenior person fails to do so, he should do upvãs on that day.  Those \nwho do not come to listen to that talk of Bhagvãn with shraddhã \nshould also do upvãs.  Please remember these words firmly in your \nlives.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 19 || 253 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 20 \nSvabhãv And Vãsnã \n \n20.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on the night of Shrãvan vad Amãs [22nd \nAugust 1827], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in His \nresidence in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n20.2 Then, Dinã-Nãth Bhatt asked a question:  “Mahãrãj, Kãl is the power \nof Bhagvãn, and karma refers to the actions performed by the jeev.  \nBut, what exactly is svabhãv?” \n \n20.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The karmas that the jeev has performed \nduring past lives have fully developed and have become absorbed \nwithin the jeev.  Just as fire ‘enters’ iron, similarly, those karmas have \ndeveloped and have become one with the jeev.  It is those karmas that \nare known as svabhãv, or vãsnã, or prakruti.” \n \n20.4 Muktãnand Swãmi then asked, “Mahãrãj, the karmas which have \nbecome absorbed within the jeev, are called svabhãv or vãsnã.  But, \nhow does a person eradicate vãsnã?” \n \n20.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “It appears that the only means to do so is by \nperforming the bhakti of Shree Krishna Bhagvãn, coupled with the \nGADHADÃ III \n- 727 - \nãtmã-nishthã.  If a person offers bhakti to Shree Krishna Bhagvãn \nwithout ãtmã-nishthã, then just as he has love for Bhagvãn, he will \nalso develop love for other material objects.  Therefore, bhakti \naccompanied by ãtmã-nishthã is the only means to eradicate vãsnã.  \nHowever, even a person who has ãtmã-nishthã may be disturbed by \nunpleasant circumstances, just like an ignorant person.  However, \nsuch disturbances do not last long.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 20 || 254 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 21 \nDharma And Ekãntik Dharma  \n \n21.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Bhãdarvã sud 9 [31st August 1827], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a mattress with a \ncylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead \noutside the west-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  \nHe was dressed entirely in white clothes, and garlands of chameli \nflowers were hanging around His neck.  A sabhã of the entire muni-\nmandal, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n21.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj requested Gopãlãnand Swãmi and Shuk Muni \nto begin a question-answer discussion. \n \n21.3 Then, Shuk Muni asked Gopãlãnand Swãmi, “It is through offering \nbhakti to Bhagvãn that the jeev crosses Bhagvãn’s Mãyã and attains \nAkshardhãm.  Through dharma, it attains Dev-Lok; but once the \nrewards it has accumulated are exhausted, the jeev falls from Dev-\nLok.  Now, whenever there is a decline in dharma, Bhagvãn assumes \nan avatãr for the purpose of restoring bhakti.  However, it appears \nthat whatever can be attained through bhakti cannot be attained \nthrough dharma.  Therefore, how can the level of dharma be elevated \nto the status of bhakti?  That is the question.” \nGADHADÃ III \n- 728 - \n21.4 Gopãlãnand Swãmi began to answer that question.  In whatever he \nsaid, dharma became a component of bhakti, but in no way could he \nelevate the level of dharma to the status of bhakti. \n \n21.5 On hearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj laughed a great deal, and \ncommented, “To answer that question is difficult indeed.  Therefore, \nallow me to answer it.”  He then explained, “Dharma is of two types:  \nOne is nivrutti dharma and the other is pravrutti dharma.  In turn, \nthese two types of dharma can either be related to Bhagvãn or not to \nBhagvãn.  Of these two, the type of dharma that is related to Bhagvãn \nis the one that was adopted by Nãrad, the Sanakãdik, Shukji, Dhruv, \nPrahlãd, and Ambrish.  It is this dharma that is known as bhãgvat \ndharma or ekãntik dharma.  In fact, this type of dharma is not \ndifferent from bhakti; they are both one.  The type of dharma that \navatãrs of Bhagvãn come to establish is this very same dharma.  On \nthe other hand, the dharma of a person’s varna and ãshram alone is \nextremely inferior compared to bhãgvat dharma, because it is \nthrough bhãgvat dharma that the jeev crosses Bhagvãn’s Mãyã and \nattains the dhãm of Purushottam.  Therefore, the status of bhãgvat \ndharma and bhakti is the same, and the rewards of both are exactly \nthe same as well; so, the greatness of bhakti and dharma are the \nsame.  In comparison, the dharma of a person’s varna and ãshram on \nits own is extremely weak, and its rewards are temporary.” \n \n21.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj then continued, “In my opinion, even if I try to \ndevelop affection for anyone other than Bhagvãn and His ekãntik \nbhaktas, I cannot do so.  I also feel that my strength is similar to that \nof Jadbharat, Shukdevji, Dattãtrey, and Rushabh-Dev Bhagvãn.  As a \nresult, I also prefer to stay only in forests, mountains, and jungles; I \ndo not like to stay in large towns or cities.  This is my inherent \nnature.  Despite this, I stay in the midst of thousands of people for the \nsake of Bhagvãn and His bhaktas.  However, I remain just as detached \nhere as I would if I were living in the forests.  I do not stay amidst \nthousands of people out of any self-interest; it is for the sake of \nBhagvãn and His bhaktas that I stay in the midst of people.  No matter \nGADHADÃ III \n- 729 - \nhow much pravrutti I may have to engage myself in for the sake of the \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn, I still consider it to be nivrutti. \n \n21.7 “Moreover, I do not see the flaws of a bhakta of Bhagvãn, however \nmuch at fault he may be.  I believe that even if there are some \nintrinsic, minor flaws in a bhakta of Bhagvãn, a person should \noverlook them.  However, if those flaws are in himself, then he should \nmake an effort to eradicate them.  Also, if that type of flaw appears in \na bhakta of Bhagvãn, he should not take note of that flaw.  A person \nshould perceive flaws in a bhakta only if he were to lapse in his \nobservance of some major vartmãn, but not on account of some other \nminor flaw.   \n \n21.8 “A person should also not be pleased by defeating a bhakta of \nBhagvãn in arguments.  Instead, he should derive pleasure in \ndeliberately losing to him.  A person who does engage in an argument \nand defeats a bhakta of Bhagvãn is a sinner worse than someone who \nhas committed the five great sins. \n \n21.9 “In addition, I do not like even the sight of a person who speaks \nunkindly of a bhakta of Bhagvãn before me.  In fact, I do not enjoy \nfood or water offered by a person who perceives flaws in a bhakta of \nBhagvãn.  If he does do so, then even if he happens to be my relative, I \nstill develop an intense dislike for him.  This is because in reality, we \nare the ãtmã; so, why should we keep affection for our body and the \nrelatives of the body?  We have developed affection for Bhagvãn and \nHis bhaktas believing ourselves to be an ãtmã, not out of the belief \nthat we are the body. \n \n21.10 “The inner enemies, such as kãm, krodh, lobh, moh, will certainly \ndistress a person who is unable to behave as the ãtmã.  Therefore, if a \nperson offers bhakti without attaining ãtmã-nishthã, his true nature \nis sure to be exposed in this satsang.  This is because this satsang is \nalokik, and all these satsangis are exactly like Bhagvãn’s pãrshads \nresiding in Shvet-Dvip, Vaikunth, and Golok.  I take oath on Bhagvãn \nGADHADÃ III \n- 730 - \nand His bhaktas that I realise these satsangis to be the same as the \npãrshads of Bhagvãn residing in the divya Akshardhãm. \n \n21.11 “However, a person whose gnãn, vairãgya, dharma, and bhakti are \nnot extremely firm will most certainly fall back in satsang.  For \nexample, a thread dipped in wax remains stiff in winter and \nmonsoon, but when summer comes, it becomes loose.  In the same \nway, monsoon and winter represent the period when the bhaktas \nhere are happy in every way and are also honoured in satsang.  \nDuring that period, gnãn, vairãgya, dharma, and bhakti appear to be \nvery intense.  However, with the arrival of summer – the period when \na bhakta is insulted in satsang or when he becomes physically \ndistressed – his gnãn, vairãgya, dharma, and bhakti become loose like \nthe thread dipped in wax.  Even then, I do not abandon such a person.  \nHowever, he becomes obliged to leave satsang of his own accord.  \nThen, even if he is supposedly a satsangi, he does not experience the \nbliss of satsang within. \n \n21.12 “For this reason, a person should practise satsang with intense \nfirmness after attaining ãtmã-nishthã; he should not practise satsang \nin such a way that affection for his body and his relatives persists.  To \ncontinue the analogy, a thread of gold remains the same in all six \nseasons; it does not become loose even during the heat of summer.  \nSimilarly, when a person’s satsang is firm, regardless of the amount \nof misery that he may encounter, and however many times he is \ninsulted in satsang, his mind never turns away from satsang.  Only \nsuch loyal satsangi Vaishnavs are my relatives; and I wish to stay in \nKrishna Bhagvãn’s dhãm.  This is my decision, and all of you should \nalso make the same decision. \n \n21.13 “I say this because as you have all become my ãshrit, I should tell you \nthat which is beneficial to you.  After all, a true friend is a person who \ntells us that which benefits us, even if it may appear to be hurtful.  \nPlease realise this as the characteristic of a true friend.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 21 || 255 || \nGADHADÃ III \n- 731 - \nGadhadã III – 22 \nLoving Bhakti \n \n22.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Bhãdarvã vad 4 [9th September 1827], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on the veranda \noutside the west-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  \nHe was dressed entirely in white clothes.  Tassels of white flowers \nwere hanging from his pãgh, and garlands of white flowers were \nhanging around His neck.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.  Some \nparamhans were singing a vishnupad to the accompaniment of a \ndukad and sarodã.  Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in the sabhã with \nantar-drashti. \n \n22.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The strength of profound, loving bhakti \nin a bhakta of Bhagvãn, as described in this kirtan, is the strength of \nJhinã-Bhãi, and it was the strength of Parvat-Bhãi and Mulji Brahm-\nChãri as well.  While keeping antar-drashti, I was thinking that there \nmust also be others in this satsang with the same strength.  A person \nwho develops this strength of profound, loving bhakti loses all \nattachment to the panch-vishays and is able to maintain ãtmã-nishthã \nwithout even having to try.” \n \n22.3 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Narsinh Mehtã worshipped Shree \nKrishna Bhagvãn with a sense of friendship, whereas many bhaktas of \nBhagvãn, such as Nãrad, worshipped Bhagvãn with sevã.  Of these \ntwo types of bhaktas, whose bhakti should be regarded as being \nbetter?” \n \n22.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The type of bhakti offered by Narsinh \nMehtã, the gopis, Nãrad, and the Sanakãdik is not of two types; in \nreality, it is of one type.  After all, the body – be it male or female – is \nworldly and perishable. However, the jeevãtmã, the worshipper, is \nneither male nor female, but is chetan.  When the jeevãtmã leaves its \nbody and travels to the dhãm of Bhagvãn, it assumes a svarup \naccording to the wish of Bhagvãn; or, depending upon the \nGADHADÃ III \n- 732 - \nopportunity for sevã that arises there, that bhakta assumes an \nappropriate svarup and performs the sevã of Bhagvãn accordingly. \n \n22.5 “However, if a bhakta of Bhagvãn develops the same attachment to \nwealth, women and other objects as he has towards Bhagvãn, then he \ncannot be called a loyal bhakta of Bhagvãn.  Having become a bhakta \nof Bhagvãn, if a person commits sins and accumulates harmful \ndesires in satsang itself while offering bhakti, then those sins become \nembedded in him – as if etched in iron.  Moreover, a greater sin than \nassociating with the wife of another man due to the influence of evil \ncompany is to look at a bhakta of Bhagvãn lustfully while in satsang.  \nTherefore, a person who wishes to develop deep attachment to \nBhagvãn should not allow any type of sin to remain in his mind.  This \nis because female satsangi bhaktas are to be viewed as a person’s \nown mother, sister, or daughter.  Those who look at women of their \nown family lustfully are the extremely evil sinners in this world.  So, a \nperson who looks at bhaktas lustfully is an evil sinner and will never \nbe released from that sin.  That is why a person who wishes to \nbecome a rasik bhakta should become a rasik bhakta after avoiding \nthis kind of sin. \n \n22.6 “Having said this, the greatest of all sins is perceiving faults in \nBhagvãn and His bhaktas, because due to that fault-finding attitude, \nhatred is created towards them.  Even if a person has killed millions \nof cows, consumed alcohol and meat, and committed adultery with \nthe wife of his guru countless times, he can still be released from such \nsins at some time or other.  However, a person who insults Bhagvãn \nand His bhaktas will never be released from his sin.  Then, if the \nperson insulting Bhagvãn and His bhaktas is a male, he will become a \nmale demon; or if female, she will become a female demon.  Then, \neven after countless lives, that person will never stop being a demon \nand will never become a bhakta of Bhagvãn. \n \n22.7 “Furthermore, a person who has already insulted a bhakta of \nBhagvãn and whose insulting attitude has become established will \nGADHADÃ III \n- 733 - \nunder no circumstances be able to eradicate that attitude.  On the \nother hand, another person who is in the process of insulting, \nrealises, ‘I have committed a great sin by insulting Bhagvãn and His \nbhaktas; therefore I am extremely evil, and Bhagvãn and His bhaktas \nare extremely great’.  When a person sees the qualities of others and \nsees faults within himself in this way, then any sins he may have \ncommitted will be eradicated, however great they may be. \n \n22.8 “No other sin displeases and hurts Bhagvãn more than the sin of \ninsulting His bhaktas.  When Jay and Vijay insulted the Sanakãdik in \nVaikunth, Bhagvãn immediately rushed to the Sanakãdik and told \nthem, ‘Whoever insults sãdhus like you is my enemy.  Therefore, you \nhave done well in giving a curse to Jay and Vijay.  In fact, if my own \nhand were to harm brãhmans like you, then even I would cut off my \nhand; so what can I say to others?’  This is what Vishnu Bhagvãn said \nto the Sanakãdik.  As a result, Jay and Vijay became demons due to \nthe sin of insulting the devout bhaktas of Bhagvãn. Others who have \nalso insulted bhaktas of Bhagvãn have all fallen from their high \nposition – a fact that is well noted in the shãstras.  Therefore, a \nperson who desires the best for himself should not insult the bhaktas \nof Bhagvãn.  If a person does happen to knowingly or unknowingly \ninsult someone, then he should bow at that person’s feet, pray to him, \nand act in a way that pleases him.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 22 || 256 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 23 \nMãnsi Pujã \n \n23.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on the night of Ãso sud Punam [22nd October \n1828], Swãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead that had been placed in the yard of His residence in Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \nGADHADÃ III \n- 734 - \n23.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj, out of compassion, addressed all the bhaktas \nand said, “A person who is a bhakta of Bhagvãn daily performs the \nmãnsi pujã of Bhagvãn.   A person should perform that mãnsi pujã in \ndifferent ways, depending on the three seasons: summer, winter, and \nmonsoon.  \n \n23.3 “During the four months of summer, a person should perform pujã by \nfirst bathing Bhagvãn with cool, fragrant, pure water.  He should then \noffer Him a beautiful, washed, thin, white khes to wear.  After seating \nBhagvãn on a beautiful seat, His whole body should be smeared with \nfragrant sandalwood from the Malay mountains, which has been \ncollected in a bowl after forming it into a paste.  Firstly, the \nsandalwood paste should be smeared on His forehead and closely \nobserved; then the paste should be smeared on His chest, stomach, \nthighs, calves, and other parts of His body.  Those parts should also \nbe observed.  Then, beautiful kum-kum should be applied on His holy \nfeet as well as on the soles of His feet, and they too should then be \nobserved.  Then, garlands of fragrant flowers, such as mogrã, chameli, \nchampã, and roses, as well as various jewellery, and bãjubandh and \nberkhã made of flowers should be offered.  A fine cloth that is not too \nheavy and is as white as a mogrã flower should be tied around His \nhead; and a beautiful, white cloth which is fine and light, should be \nwrapped around His body.  Then, he should embrace Bhagvãn – once, \nor twice, or according to the degree of his love.  Then, he should \ntouch Bhagvãn’s holy feet to his own chest and head.  During the \nembrace, the sandalwood paste on Bhagvãn’s body, as well as parts of \nthe garlands of flowers, may stick to his own body; and kum-kum may \nalso stick as a result of touching Bhagvãn’s holy feet to his own chest \nand head.  All this should be visualised, and he should feel, \n‘Sandalwood paste, kum-kum, and garlands blessed by Bhagvãn have \ntouched my body!’ \n \n23.4 “During the four months of winter, a person should perform pujã by \nfirst bathing Bhagvãn with warm water, and then offering Him a \nwhite khes to wear.  He should then seat Bhagvãn on a decorated \nGADHADÃ III \n- 735 - \nbedstead with a velvet mattress that has been covered with a white \nsheet.  He should offer a survãl, offer a dagli, tie a rich orange reto of \ngolden threads around His head, tie a rich reto around His waist, and \nplace a rich reto over His shoulders.  Then, he should place various \ntypes of jewellery made of diamonds, pearls, gold, and rubies on \nvarious parts of His body, and also a pearl necklace.  After offering \nthese clothes and jewellery, the various parts of Bhagvãn’s body \nshould be closely observed.  A kum-kum chãndlo should also be \napplied to Bhagvãn’s forehead. \n \n23.5 “During the four months of monsoon, a person should perform pujã \nimagining that Bhagvãn has returned from some village, and His \nwhite clothes have become completely drenched; or that He had gone \nto bathe with the paramhans in a river and has returned from there \ncompletely drenched.  After removing His wet clothes, He should be \noffered deep orange garments to wear, and His forehead should be \nsmeared with yellow sandalwood paste mixed with saffron. \n \n23.6 “During summer, a person should visualise Bhagvãn to be sitting \neither in an open place or in a flower garden.  During winter and \nmonsoon, he should visualise Bhagvãn to be seated in a medi, or \ninside a house.  In particular, when offering Bhagvãn something to \neat, only those foods – that are chewed, drunk, licked, or sucked – \nwhich he likes to eat should be visualised for offering to Bhagvãn.  \nEven if Bhagvãn does not like these foods, when offering items to \nHim, a person should still visualise only those items that he enjoys \nhimself.  Also, incense, oil lamps, flowers, and ãrti should be offered \nto Bhagvãn as appropriate. \n \n23.7 “In this way, a bhakta who offers pujã in different ways according to \nthe three different seasons increases his love for Bhagvãn, and his \njeev benefits tremendously.  Therefore, whoever has heard this talk \nshould remember it and daily perform the mãnsi pujã of Bhagvãn in \nthe way described.  As a matter of fact, I have never talked about this \nbefore.” \nGADHADÃ III \n- 736 - \n23.8 Shreeji Mahãrãj then spoke on another topic.  He said, “When \nBhagvãn and His bhaktas are pleased on a bhakta, he should feel, ‘It is \nmy great fortune that Bhagvãn and His bhaktas are pleased with me’.  \nAlso, when they lecture him, for the purpose of teaching a lesson, he \nshould feel, ‘It is my great fortune that they lecture me; after all, it will \nhelp in removing my flaws’.  In this way, a person should be pleased \neven if lectured; he should not feel any grief in his mind, nor get \nupset, nor even regard himself as being very sinful.  He should always \nremain pleased.  This attitude should always be remembered.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 23 || 257 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 24 \nSixteen Spiritual Activities \nVairãgya Due To Gnãn \n \n24.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Ãso vad 12 [4th November 1828], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was sitting in the mandir of Shree Gopinãthji in Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \n \n24.2 Then, Muktãnand Swãmi asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “The bhaktas remain \nin Bhagvãn’s sevã in Akshardhãm.  What are the spiritual activities \nneeded to earn such sevã?” \n \n24.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “An ekãntik bhakta easily earns Bhagvãn’s \nsevã in Akshardhãm through sixteen spiritual activities: shraddhã; \nsvadharma; vairãgya; total control over the indriyas; ahinsã; brahm-\nchãrya; keeping the company of sãdhus; ãtmã-nishthã; unwavering \nbhakti to Bhagvãn coupled with the knowledge of His greatness; \nhappiness; honesty; compassion; penance; treating senior bhaktas \nwith greater qualities as gurus and also maintaining deep respect for \nthem; maintaining a feeling of friendship towards those bhaktas who \nGADHADÃ III \n- 737 - \nare his equal; and treating those bhaktas who are junior to him as a \nshishya and acting for their benefit.” \n \n24.4 Shuk Muni then asked, “All of our sãdhus observe vartmãns.  But, \nwhat characteristic in a sãdhu would enable us to be sure that the \nsãdhu would never deviate from his dharma even in times of \ndifficulty?” \n \n24.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj answered, “A sãdhu whose attention is constantly \nfocused on all of those ãgnãs given by Bhagvãn, whether they are \nmajor or minor; and who finds it extremely difficult to disobey any \nãgnã; and who acts neither excessively nor in a careless way \nregarding those ãgnãs, should be known as a person who would not \nfall from his dharma despite difficult circumstances.” \n \n24.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj then spoke out of compassion:  “It is very difficult for \na person to eradicate his svabhãv.  Regardless of this, if he has \nrealised that satsang fulfils his self-interest, then it is not difficult to \ndo so.  For example, the members of Dãdã Khãchar’s family have an \ninterest in keeping me here, so they do not retain any svabhãv that I \ndo not like.  In this way, a person’s svabhãv can be eradicated due to \nself-interest.  It can also be eradicated out of fear, although not \ntotally.  This is because a person may fear someone in his presence, \nbut when that person is not present, he may no longer be fearful – \njust as a thief abandons his corrupt nature due to fear of the king. \n \n24.7 “Furthermore, despite the fact that I have repeatedly fired harsh \nwords and upset a person who possesses some svabhãv or another, if \nhe is not disheartened in any way at all, then I have such love for that \nperson that the love remains effortlessly as it is, in the jãgrat state \nand svapna state.  Regardless of whatever happens, that love does not \ndiminish. \n \n24.8 “Moreover, of the various gun possessed by bhaktas, I shall now \nnarrate one admirable gun in each bhakta.  Dãdã Khãchar – gun of \nfaith; Rãj-Bãi – gun of tyãg; Jeevu-Bã – gun of shraddhã, Lãdu-Bã – \nGADHADÃ III \n- 738 - \ngun of desiring to please me; Nityãnand Swãmi – gun of desiring to \nplease me; Brahmãnand Swãmi – gun of insisting that there should be \nno lapse at all in observing the niyams of satsang; Muktãnand Swãmi  \n– gun of desiring to please me and having faith in me; Somlã Khãchar \n– gun of always behaving consistently; Chaitanyãnand Swãmi – gun of \nwishing to behave in such a way that pleases Mahãrãj in any way; \nSvayamprakãshãnand Swãmi – gun of nishchay in Bhagvãn and \nrealising His greatness; Jhinã-Bhãi Thãkor – gun of having awareness, \nfor fear that he becomes attached to any object other than Bhagvãn; \nand Motã Ãtmãnand Swãmi – gun of ensuring that none of my ãgnãs \nare disobeyed.”  In this way, Shreeji Mahãrãj narrated the gun of \nmany senior paramhans and other bhaktas. \n \n24.9 He then continued, “The three senior ladies of this place (Rãj-Bãi, \nJeevu-Bã, and Lãdu-Bã), and Gopãlãnand Swãmi, Brahmãnand \nSwãmi, Muktãnand Swãmi, Nityãnand Swãmi, Shuk Muni, Somlã \nKhãchar, and Dãdã Khãchar – all of you presently behave very well.  \nHowever, if the four factors of desh, kãl, kriyã, and sang were to \nbecome unpleasant, then there is no doubt at all that your \nenthusiasm would not remain as it is now.  However, if a person who \nhas a great degree of gnãn were to be caught in the vishays, he would \nbreak free from that attachment.  This gnãn is the understanding, ‘I, \nthe jeev, am like this; the body is like this; the relations of the body are \nlike this; the nature of Prakruti, Purush, virãt, sutrãtmã, and avyãkrut \nis like this; Bhagvãn is like this; and the dhãm of Bhagvãn is like this’, \nand so on.  If a person has firm belief of this gnãn in his heart, then \nthe vairãgya that results is true vairãgya.  Apart from that, any other \nform of vairãgya only superficially appears to be vairãgya; in fact, \nthere is no strength in it.  For example, the flame of an oil lamp is \nextinguished by the wind, whereas the vadvãnal fire and fire of \nlightning in the clouds is not extinguished by water; despite \nremaining in water itself, it continues to burn.  In the same way, \nvairãgya without gnãn does not last when it encounters the vishays.  \nOn the other hand, vairãgya produced from gnãn does not diminish \nGADHADÃ III \n- 739 - \ndespite encountering the vishays; it continues to burn like the \nvadvãnal fire. \n \n24.10 “It is precisely for the purpose of somehow instilling this gnãn in \nyour minds that I continuously deliver talks.  If a talk eventually does \ntruly inspire you, then this gnãn will become instilled in you.  On the \nother hand, if a person does not understand this and instead has a \nsense of ‘I-ness’ and ‘my-ness’ by believing, ‘This is my varna, this is \nmy mother, this is my father, these are my relatives’, then he should be \nknown to be an extremely ignorant person with a worldly \nperception.” \n \n24.11 Having said this, Shreeji Mahãrãj again spoke out of compassion:  \n“What is the reason behind a mumukshu attaining noble qualities?  \nWell, a person develops hatred for the world in proportion to the \nattachment he has for listening to the talks and kathãs of Bhagvãn. \nAlso, vicious natures, such as kãm, krodh, lobh, and moh, are also \ndestroyed to that extent.  Conversely, if a person is lazy in listening to \nthose talks and kathãs, then he should assume that he will not \nremember noble shãstras. In fact, out of the nine types of bhakti \nmentioned in the shãstras, the bhakti of listening to kathãs  is \nconsidered to be the best.  Therefore, a person who possesses that \nform of bhakti will attain all the various forms of bhakti up to the \nincluding profound, loving bhakti.”  Shreeji Mahãrãj delivered the talk \nin this way. \n \n24.12 At noon on that same day, when all the paramhans were seated for \ntheir meals in a line on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of \nDãdã Khãchar’s darbãr, Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead that had been placed under the neem tree. \n \n24.13 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said to the paramhans, “A person should not \nunderstand the greatness of female bhaktas in excess.  This is \nbecause under the excuse of realising their greatness, he may \nconstantly think of them, leading to them appearing in his dreams.  \nSo, if a person does understand their greatness, he should \nGADHADÃ III \n- 740 - \nunderstand it collectively, by thinking, ‘All of them are bhaktas of \nBhagvãn’.  However, he should not attempt to understand a \nparticular bhakta as being greater and another bhakta being lesser.  \nIf he attempts to understand their greatness to a greater or lesser \ndegree than this, then there is a great danger in that.  Similarly, \nfemale bhaktas should also understand the greatness of male bhaktas \ncollectively.  If they do not realise this, then it is also a great danger \nfor those females.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 24 || 258 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 25 \nRaj-Bãi’s Question \n \n25.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Kãrtik sud 10 [16th November 1828], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated \nbedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dãdã \nKhãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \n \n25.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj spoke out of compassion:  “Bhakti, upãsanã, \nsevã, shraddhã, firmness in observing dharma, and other spiritual \nactivities related to Bhagvãn should all be performed without having \ndesires for any rewards.  This fact is mentioned in the sacred \nshãstras, and it is true; but, a person should certainly have the \nfollowing desire:  ‘May Bhagvãn become pleased with me through \nthese activities’.  That desire should be kept.  On the other hand, if a \nperson does not keep such a desire and acts without any specific \npurpose, then he should be known to possess tamo-gun.  Therefore, a \nperson should develop the qualities of bhakti, upãsanã, sevã, \nshraddhã, and dharma with the desire for rewards in the form of the \nhappiness of Bhagvãn.  If a person has any desire other than that, he \nwill attain only rewards such as the four types of mukti. \nGADHADÃ III \n- 741 - \n25.3 “Furthermore, it is not the case that Bhagvãn’s happiness is bestowed \nonly on those who offer bhakti with various items and not upon the \npoor.  Someone may be poor, but if he offers water, leaves, fruits, and \nflowers to Bhagvãn with shraddhã, that is enough to please Him.  This \nis because Bhagvãn is extremely great.  Just as a king rewards \nsomeone who composes even a verse in his praise with a village, \nsimilarly, Bhagvãn also becomes pleased instantly.” \n \n \n25.4 Continuing, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Who can be called a true bhakta of \nBhagvãn?  If some prolonged illness were to overtake a person’s \nbody; or if he receives neither food to eat nor any clothes to wear; or \nregardless of the extent of pain or pleasure that come his way, if he \nstill does not fall back even slightly from the worship of bhakti of \nBhagvãn, niyams, dharma, or shraddhã, but progresses with time, \nthen he is called a true bhakta.” \n \n25.5 Then, Rãj-Bãi had a question asked to Shreeji Mahãrãj, “Which gun \npleases you, and which avgun displeases you?” \n \n25.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “The following are the avgun of speech:  If \nsomeone wishes to behave in some special way, then he should notify \nme only once by saying:  ‘Mahãrãj, if you agree, then I shall behave like \nthis’.  I do not like it when a person repeatedly asks, ‘Mahãrãj, why \nare you not telling me whether I should behave like this or behave like \nthat?’  I do not like a person who, despite knowing me as his ishta-\ndev, repeatedly questions my words.  I do not like a person who \ninterrupts me while I am speaking to someone.  Regarding the \nperformance of religious actions, such as performing dhyãn upon \nBhagvãn, observance of dharma, offering bhakti, I do not like a \nperson who throws the burden of such actions on Bhagvãn by \nthinking, ‘Only if Bhagvãn wishes are these possible’.  Also, I do not like \na person who thinks, ‘I shall do this; and I shall do that’, and then \nrelies only on his own strength and not on the strength of Bhagvãn.  I \nextremely dislike a person who speaks inconsistently and rudely.  I \ndo not like a person who feels a sense of shame or laziness when it \nGADHADÃ III \n- 742 - \ncomes to talking of Bhagvãn, listening to kathãs, or singing kirtans, \nand yet feels no shame or laziness in performing worldly activities.  \nAlso, I do not like a person who boasts of his tyãg or bhakti, or of \nanything else.  I do not like a person who sits behind everyone else \nduring a sabhã instead of sitting as suits his own status.  Moreover, \nwhen seniors are seated in a sabhã, I do not like a person who \nforcibly pushes them aside to take his own place at the front of the \nsabhã. \n \n25.7 “In addition, I am pleased with female bhaktas who behave morally \nby covering their own bodies and who keep their gaze cast \ndownwards when they walk, instead of keeping a wandering gaze.  \nMany times, instead of doing my darshan with a fixed gaze, someone \nmay abandon that darshan and look repeatedly in the direction of an \napproaching man or woman, or a dog walking by, or cattle walking \nby, or in the direction of some noise.  On such a person, I feel so much \ndisgust that I feel, ‘What can I do?  If I had not become a sãdhu, I would \nbeat him in some way!’  But, that is not possible since beating \nsomeone is extremely inappropriate for a sãdhu. I also do not like a \nperson who conceals the truth – who does not reveal the disturbing \nthoughts that arise in his mind to an appropriate person.  Also, these \nthree things are extremely harmful:  mãn, krodh, and being so \nsuppressed by others that what is in the mind cannot be revealed.  \nAlso, if bhaktas become disrespectful because they view each other as \nequals and do not maintain respect for one another, that is also \nextremely inappropriate.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 25 || 259 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 26 \nA Sant Who Is Worthy Of Sevã Equally To Bhagvãn \n \n26.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Kãrtik sud 11 [17th November 1828], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in the mandir of Shree \nGADHADÃ III \n- 743 - \nGopinãthji in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n26.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked, “What are the characteristics of a sant \nwho is worthy of sevã equally to Bhagvãn?  Well, such a sant \nsuppresses the actions of Mãyã’s gun (sattva-gun, rajo-gun, and tamo-\ngun), such as the indriyas and the antah-karans; but, he himself does \nnot get suppressed by their actions.  In addition to this, he only \nperforms activities related to Bhagvãn; he is loyal in his observance \nof the panch-vartmãn; and believing himself to be brahm-rup, he \nworships Purushottam Bhagvãn.  Such a sant should not be thought of \nas a human being, nor should he be thought of as a dev, because such \nbehaviour is not possible for either humans or devs.  In reality, even \nthough that sant appears to be human, he is still worthy of sevã \nequally to Bhagvãn.  Therefore, whoever desires to attain kalyãn \nshould perform the sevã of such sant.  Also, females should perform \nsevã of females possessing such qualities.” \n \n26.3 Then, Ãtmãnand Swãmi asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “Regardless of how \nordinary a person may be, as long as he stays within the limits of the \nvartmãns of this satsang, he will not become bound by the panch-\nvishays.  Please narrate the characteristics of a person who cannot \nbecome bound by the panch-vishays, even though he may happen to \nleave satsang due to unpleasant circumstances.” \n \n26.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “If a person has dharma \npredominant in his mind; and if he has the qualities of an ãstik where \nhe firmly believes, ‘A person who performs moral and immoral karmas \nin this lok will undoubtedly receive the rewards  of those karmas in the \nlok beyond’; and if he has such firm beliefs, and is concerned about his \nown reputation by thinking, ‘If I do something immoral, what will \npeople think of me?’, then he will not become bound by any object \nwherever he goes.  For example, those like Mayã-Rãm Bhatt, Mulji \nGADHADÃ III \n- 744 - \nBrahm-Chãri, and Nishkulãnand Swãmi will never falter even if they \nencounter women or wealth. \n \n26.5 “However, a person who is like this may have the characteristics of \nfalse ãtmã-nishthã in thinking, ‘I am the ãtmã; I am brahm; so, I am \nnot affected by good or bad actions, and I am absolutely detached from \neverything’.  Also, he may falsely understand the greatness of \nBhagvãn, and he may talk a great deal about that greatness, by \nsaying, ‘The greatness of Bhagvãn is so intense!  So, what harm is there \nin deviating from dharma?’  In such a person, these two types of flaws \ncould become major obstacles in the observance of dharma.  \nTherefore, it is better if he has genuine ãtmã-nishthã, if he thoroughly \nunderstands the greatness of Bhagvãn, and if he firmly observes the \nvarious types of dharma with understanding, and becomes nishkãmi, \nnirlobhi, nisvãdi, nisnehi, and nirmãni in order to please Bhagvãn.  \nSuch a person believes, ‘If I follow dharma, Bhagvãn will be extremely \npleased with me; and if I deviate from dharma in any way, then \nBhagvãn will be extremely displeased with me’.  If he has this firm \nbelief, then that bhakta will never falter from dharma in any way.  On \nthe other hand, if a person does not have this kind of understanding, \nthen regardless of how much gnãn he may have, or how much bhakti \nhe may offer, he may still deviate from dharma or become bound by \nmãyik objects.  This is a fundamental truth.” \n \n26.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj again addressed the sabhã out of compassion:  “I do \nnot like ahankãr.  That ahankãr may be of a person’s qualities of \nbhakti, tyãg, or vairãgya; of a person’s attainment of the qualities of \nbrahm; of a person’s understanding; or of a person’s observance of \nthe panch-vartmãn.  I do not like these or any other forms of ahankãr.  \nAlso, I do not like dambh.  What is dambh?  Well, although a person \nmay not have much nishchay, bhakti, or dharma, to outwardly \npretend to possess them to a great extent in order to look good in \nfront of others is dambh.  I do not like that; and nor do I like a person \nwho eliminates the difference between himself and Bhagvãn.  I also \ndo not like a person who behaves freely liberally – after taking a vow, \nGADHADÃ III \n- 745 - \nhe adheres to it occasionally and relaxes from it occasionally. In \naddition, I do not like a person who considers himself to be extremely \ninsignificant after having extensively understood the intense glory of \nBhagvãn, and who does not believe his true svarup to be the ãtmã, \nwhich is distinct from the body. \n \n26.7 “Now, I shall describe the type of person I do like.  Such a person \nthoroughly understands the greatness of Bhagvãn.  He understands \nhis ãtmã – which is vyatirek from the body – to be brahm-rup.  He \nfirmly observes dharma and also engages in the bhakti of Bhagvãn.  \nDespite having such qualities, if there is some bhakta in satsang who \ndoes not understand anything, but has nishchay in Bhagvãn, then he \nwould consider that bhakta to be great, and himself to be \ninsignificant in comparison to that bhakta.  When speaking, such a \nperson never reveals even the slightest pride of his wisdom.  I am \nextremely pleased with a person who behaves in this way.” \n \n26.8 Having delivered this talk, Shreeji Mahãrãj returned to His residence.  \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 26 || 260 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 27 \nAll Bliss Is Found In The Murti Of Bhagvãn \n \n27.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Kãrtik sud Punam [21st November 1828], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in the mandir of Shree \nGopinãthji in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n27.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The pleasures associated with shabda, \nsparsh, rup, ras, and gandh, are all found to exist together in one place \n– in the blissful and divya murti of Purushottam Bhagvãn.  When we \nhave the darshan of that murti of Bhagvãn, we can enjoy the bliss of \nthat beauty, as well as the bliss of the other four types of vishays, all \nGADHADÃ III \n- 746 - \nat the same time.  However, with worldly vishays, when a person \nindulges in one vishay, he receives the pleasure of only that vishay, \nbut not of the others.  Therefore, the pleasures of worldly vishays are \nfound separately.  Moreover, those pleasures are useless, perishable, \nand the cause of extreme misery.  However, in Bhagvãn, a person \nenjoys the bliss of all the vishays at the same time.  That bliss is \nextremely divya; it is eternal and imperishable.  Therefore, a \nmumukshu should develop vairãgya towards the worldly vishays and \nbecome totally attached to the divya and blissful murti of Bhagvãn.” \n \n27.3 Shreeji Mahãrãj then continued, “If a bhakta has an intense desire to \nengage in the bhakti of Bhagvãn and to associate with His sant, then \nregardless of any svabhãv that he may possess, he eradicates it and \nbehaves according to the sant’s wishes.  Even if that svabhãv is such \nthat it has become bound to the chaitanya, a person who has an \nintense desire to do satsang will eradicate it.”  With that, He narrated \nHis own story:  “Initially, my nature was like that of a tyãgi, but \nbecause I had an intense desire for the darshan of Rãmãnand Swãmi, \nI lived according to Muktãnand Swãmi’s instructions, and not \naccording to my personal preferences.” \n \n27.4 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The details of the kind of determination \na bhakta should and should not keep are as follows:  The first type of \ndetermination is observing the vows, such as nishkãmi and nirlobhi; \nthe second type of determination is behaving with the feeling that he \nwill be able to sleep only if his place is here and not if it is elsewhere.  \nThe second type and other innumerable forms of determination that \nare the result of insignificant svabhãvs should not be considered the \nsame as the first type of determination.  The determination of \nobserving vartmãns is an essential as a person’s own life; it is \nextremely beneficial.  That type of determination should be kept with \nan understanding of its importance.  But, if the second type of \ndetermination is formed, which is due to svabhãvs, it should be \nthought of as worthless; and if a sant asks a person to abandon it, \nGADHADÃ III \n- 747 - \nthen it should be abandoned.  However, the first type of \ndetermination should not be abandoned. \n \n27.5 “To consider these two forms of determination as equivalent is \nfoolishness.  For example, if a child has almonds in his fist, and if \nsomeone attempts to make him give them up, he will not.  \nFurthermore, if he has a fist full of rupees or a fist full of gold coins, \nand if someone attempts to make him give them up, he will not give \nthem up.  Therefore, it can be said that the child considers the \nalmonds, and rupees, and the gold coins to be of equal value.  \nTherefore, the child can be considered to be ignorant. \n \n27.6 “If someone has almonds in his hand, and a thief comes and threatens \nhim by saying, ‘Put them down, or I will cut off your head with this \nsword’, then a person who is wise will give them away, but a person \nwho is foolish will not.  Similarly, between the two types of \ndetermination, a person should realise which is significant and which \nis insignificant.  If someone does not understand this and considers \nboth to be equivalent, then he should be known to have a svabhãv of \nstubbornness and arrogance.  If such a person does observe the \nvartmãns due to that determination, and if he remains in satsang in \nthis way till the end, then it is all well and good; but a person cannot \nhave complete faith in him.  This is because if he is offended by some \nremarks, or if his self-importance is not maintained, then he will not \nremain as he is.  On the other hand, a person who offers bhakti to \nBhagvãn and observes vartmãns  with determination is called a \nrãjarshi; and a person who offers bhakti to Bhagvãn while observing \nvartmãns with the intention of pleasing Bhagvãn is called a \nbrahmarshi and a sãdhu.  There is a similar difference in the rewards \nof the two as well.” \n \n27.7 Continuing, Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The flaws of mãn, irshyã, and \nkrodh are much more harmful than even kãm.  This is because a sant \nmay have compassion on a person with kãm, but he will not have \ncompassion on person with mãn.  In addition, irshyã and krodh \nGADHADÃ III \n- 748 - \nevolve from mãn.  Therefore, mãn is a major flaw.  Furthermore, a \nperson does not fall from satsang due to kãm as he does due to mãn.  \nFor example, there are many grahastha bhaktas in our satsang, and \nthey continue to remain in satsang.  So, I always have an intense \ndislike for mãn, irshyã, and krodh.  You will find this verified in my \nspoken words which have been written down.  Also, if you reflect \nupon them, then you will realise this to be true as well.  Therefore, a \nperson should eradicate mãn by realising the greatness of Bhagvãn.” \n \n27.8 Again, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “What is nishchay in Bhagvãn?  Well, \nconsider how it is in worldly life.  Since childhood, a person has the \nbelief of his parents, varna, and ãshram, and gender, as well as the \nbelief that this is an animal, this is a man, this is water, this is fire, this \nis the earth, this is the wind, this is the sky, and so on.  All this is due \nto the shãstras.  Even if a person has not heard the shãstras, he has \nbeen convinced by principles prevalent in society, which themselves \nwere derived from the shãstras.  Similarly, the characteristics of a \nsant, who is free of vicious natures like kãm, lobh, mãn, svãd, and \nmoh, are also described in the shãstras.  A sant who possesses these \ncharacteristics has direct relationship with Bhagvãn.  Therefore, a \nperson should develop nishchay in Bhagvãn based on His words.  In \nfact, to have firm faith in the words of the sant is itself nishchay in \nBhagvãn.” \n \n27.9 Then, Nãth Bhakta of Vadodarã asked Shreeji Mahãrãj a question:  \n“Do the relatives of a bhakta of Bhagvãn, who has firm nishchay in \nBhagvãn, attain kalyãn due to their relationship with that bhakta?” \n \n27.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “If the relatives or ancestors of a bhakta of \nBhagvãn have affection for him, then yes, they will attain kalyãn; \notherwise, they will not.  In fact, even if a person who is not related to \nthat bhakta has affection for him, then he will also benefit.  This is \nbecause at the time of death, a person may remember that bhakta \nwhose vrutti is constantly fixed on Bhagvãn.  Therefore, by \nremembering that bhakta, he attains kalyãn.” \nGADHADÃ III \n- 749 - \n27.11 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “I talk about the nature of the ãtmã and \nabout the nature of Bhagvãn.  However, by merely talking about them \na person does not experience their bliss as it really is.  Their true \nbliss can only be experienced in samãdhi, or after a person leaves his \nbody; but it cannot be experienced by merely talking about it.  For \nexample, the pleasure of looking at an attractive object can only be \nenjoyed by the eyes.  If someone were to praise that pleasure with his \nmouth by saying, ‘I saw a very beautiful object’, then the pleasure \nexperienced by the mouth is not the same as that experienced by the \neyes.  Similarly, a person may attempt to praise with words the \npleasure of sounds heard by the ears, fragrances smelt by the nose, \nsensations felt by the skin, and flavours tasted by the tongue, by \nsaying, ‘It was an extremely pleasant smell; it had a delicious taste; it \nfelt very good; it sounded nice’.  However, he does not experience \npleasure through words as he experiences pleasure through the \nindriyas.  \n \n27.12 Similarly, the bliss and the happiness of Bhagvãn that he experiences, \nas well as the bliss and the happiness of the ãtmã that he experiences \nthrough samãdhi or after leaving the body, cannot be experienced by \nmerely talking about them.  However, if a person performs shravan, \nmanan, and nididhyãs on these two topics, then he attains sãkshãtkãr.  \nThen, after attaining sãkshãtkãr, he enjoys the same experience and \nbliss as he does from these two in samãdhi.  Therefore, after listening \nto talks concerning these two, a person should perform manan and \nnididhyãs on those talks.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 27 || 261 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 28 \nFalling From The Path Of Bhagvãn’s \n \n28.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Kãrtik vad 1 [22nd November 1828], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in the mandir of Shree \nGopinãthji in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nGADHADÃ III \n- 750 - \nentirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n28.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “There are two ways in which a person \nfalls from the bhakti of Bhagvãn.  One way is by listening to shushka-\nvedãnti shãstras, where he may consider the svarup of Shree Krishna \nBhagvãn and other svarups to be false, just as he considers all other \nsvarups to be false.  Such a shushka-vedãnti should be considered to \nbe extremely ignorant.  The other way of falling is by believing, ‘If I \nworship Bhagvãn, then I will enjoy women, food, drink, and other \npleasures of the panch-vishays in Golok and Vaikunth’.  Then, due to \nthe desires of those pleasures, he forgets even Bhagvãn.  The fool, \nwith his distorted mind, believes, ‘If that enjoyment was not true, then \nBhagvãn would not associate with women like Rãdhã and Lakshmi, in \nthat dhãm.  So, that pleasure is also true’.  However, he does not \nrealise Bhagvãn to be absolutely satisfied and happy within His own \nãtmã.  In actual fact, such activities of Bhagvãn are for the purpose of \ngiving bliss to His own bhaktas.  Therefore, a person should engage in \nbhakti together with gnãn and vairãgya. \n \n28.3 “A person who has understood the greatness of Bhagvãn realises that \nonly Bhagvãn is all-blissful, whereas the pleasures derived from the \npanch-vishays have only a slight fraction of the bliss of Bhagvãn.  \nTherefore, he would never become attached to any object.  The \nMoksh-Dharma also mentions:  ‘Compared to the bliss of the dhãm of \nBhagvãn, the pleasures of the other loks are like Narak’.  This is the \nunderstanding that a bhakta of Bhagvãn should have.  If he does not \nhave this understanding, he will fall away from Bhagvãn in the two \nways mentioned.” \n \n28.4 Then, Surã Khãchar asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “Even after forming firm \nnishchay in Bhagvãn and His sant as they truly are, what is the reason \nfor someone to suffer a setback?” \n \n28.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “There was some deficiency in that person’s \nnishchay from the moment that he first established it.  What was that \nGADHADÃ III \n- 751 - \ndeficiency?  Well, if someone wishes to indulge in savoury food due \nto a desire for tasting delicious food, and if Bhagvãn or His sant \ncriticise it, then he will suffer a setback.  Or, if disturbing thoughts of \nkãm still remain, and they speak against it; or if lobh remains, and if \nthey have him criticise his lobh by telling him, ‘Give away your wealth, \nproperty, land, and farm to someone’, then he will be unable to follow \nthis ãgnã.  As a result, he suffers a setback.  Or, if a person has mãn \nand a sant criticises it and insults him, then he suffers a setback due \nto that as well.  Therefore, a person suffers a setback due to the avgun \nthat still remain in him, even though he has nishchay in Bhagvãn.  \nHowever, if a person eradicates his avgun at the beginning, when he \nestablishes his nishchay, then he will not suffer a setback.  At present, \nif those who possess these avgun thoughtfully keep antar-drashti, \nthey will be able to realise, ‘I am weak in this aspect.  So, if I am asked \nto follow such an ãgnã I will fall back from satsang and become a \nvimukh’.  In this way, they can understand themselves completely.” \n \n28.6 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked Brahmãnand Swãmi, Shuk Muni, and \nSurã Khãchar a question:  “What avgun do you possess which would \ncause you to suffer a setback?” \n \n28.7 The three of them answered, “Mahãrãj, we have the avgun of mãn.  As \na result, if a sãdhu of an equal status to us insults us, we become \nsomewhat disturbed.” \n \n28.8 Hearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj commented, “A person may have \nrealised Bhagvãn with the knowledge of His greatness as mentioned \nin the shlok: \n \ndyupataya eva ten a yayur-antam anantatayã \ntvamapi yad-antarãnda-nichayã nanu sãvaranãhã \nEven the masters of the higher loks cannot understand your greatness, \nbecause it is endless.  Neither can you yourself understand your own greatness.  \nIn your each and every hair, countless brahmãnds and their barriers (jad \nprakruti) fly simultaneously at immense speed – like specks of dust flying in \nthe air.  Even the Shrutis, ultimately perish in you, and fail to praise your glory. \nGADHADÃ III \n- 752 - \n \n“If a person has realised Bhagvãn in this way, then how can he keep \nmãn, irshyã, or krodh towards a sãdhu of such a Bhagvãn?  If he still \ndoes, then there is a flaw in his understanding.  For example, if a \nperson understands the authority of a governor – that he is the ruler \nof the whole world and that he is extremely powerful – then even if \none of his pauper-like servants were to come, even a great king \nwould obey his orders and act according to what he is told.  This is \nbecause the king has understood, ‘He is the servant of the powerful \ngovernor’.  After all, a person’s mãn does not continue in front of \nsomeone who is more powerful than himself.  Similarly, if a person \nhas understood Bhagvãn to be the master of all divine powers and \nwealth, then how can he retain mãn before a sant?” \n \n28.9 Brahmãnand Swãmi agreed, “Mahãrãj, what you are saying is correct.  \nIf a person has realised Bhagvãn and the knowledge of His greatness, \nthen he will never develop mãn, irshyã, or krodh towards a sant.” \n \n28.10 Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, “Uddhavji was so great and so intelligent.  \nHowever, because he had understood the greatness of Bhagvãn, he \nasked to be reborn as a vine so that he could be touched by the dust \nfrom the feet of the gopis who were greatly attached to Bhagvãn.  \nTherefore, it is stated: \n \nãsãm-ahe charana-renu-jushãm-aham syãm \nvrundãvane kimapi gulma-latausha-dheenãm \nyã dustyajam svajanam-ãrya-patham cha  \nhitvã bhejur-mukunda-padaveem shruti-bhir-vimru-gyãm \nThose gopis – having abandoned the bond of their bodily relations and the \npath of dharma as prescribed for the nobles – attained the state of Bhagvãn, \nwhich even the Shrutis seek.  May I also become any of the shrubs, vines, or \nherbs in Vrundãvan that are touched by the dust of their feet. \n \n \n“Even Brahmã has said, \n \naho bhãgyam-aho bhãgyam nanda-gopa-vrajaukasãm \nyan-mitram paramã-nandam purnam brahma sanãtanam \nHow fortunate is Nand, the cowherds, and the residents of Vraj – whose friend \nwas the alokik, eternal, perfect, and blissful Bhagvãn. \nGADHADÃ III \n- 753 - \n8.11 “As he had understood the greatness of Bhagvãn, even Brahmã spoke \nin this way.  Therefore, if a person realises the greatness of Bhagvãn \nand His sant in this way, mãn, irshyã, or krodh can no longer persist.  \nMoreover, he would behave as a dãs of dãs before them; and no \nmatter however much they insult him, he would never think of \nleaving their company and going away.  Also, he would never feel in \nhis mind, ‘How long should I tolerate this?  I will just stay at home and \nengage in worship there’.  Therefore, if a person understands \nBhagvãn’s greatness in such a way, mãn is eradicated.” \n \n28.12 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “If a bhakta of Bhagvãn were placed \non a shuli due to some karma of his, and if at that time I were \nstanding next to him, the bhakta would still not think, ‘It would be \ngood if Bhagvãn would free me from the pain of this shuli’.  In this way, \nhe is not concerned about his own physical comforts.  Instead, he \nendures the difficulties that fall upon him.  As a result, Bhagvãn \nbecomes extremely pleased with such a bhakta who is free of all \nexpectations.” \n \n28.13 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “I shall now describe who attains the bliss \nrelated to Bhagvãn.  First, consider the following analogy:  Water is \nthe very life of a fish.  As long as it remains in water, it is able to \nmove, swim, and perform all its activities; but the moment it leaves \nthe water, it loses its life and dies.  Similarly, if a person believes the \npanch-vishays to be his lifeline and believes them to be a source of \nhappiness, then when he is separated from them, he becomes almost \nlike a dead person.  Such a person can never attain the bliss of \nBhagvãn.  In fact, only a person who does not believe the panch-\nvishays to be his lifeline experiences Bhagvãn’s bliss; only he is able \nto indulge in the bliss; and only he attains that bliss.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 28 || 262 || \n \nGADHADÃ III \n- 754 - \nGadhadã III – 29 \nA Tyãgi And Grahastha With Moderate Vairãgya \n \n29.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on the night of Posh sud 2 [7th January \n1829], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had \nbeen placed on the platform in front of the medi in Dãdã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A \nsabhã of sãdhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had \ngathered before Him. \n \n29.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj asked Shuk Muni a question:  “Suppose there \nare two satsangis.  Both are twenty years of age, and both possess \nnishchay, sneh, bhakti, vairãgya, and dharma to an equal extent.  \nHowever, due to prãrabdha, one of them married, whereas the other \ndid not find anyone and so remained a sãnkhya-yogi.  He also had a \ndesire to marry, but he could not find someone.  Since neither of \nthem had intense vairãgya from the beginning, both have an intense \ndesire for indulging in the vishays.  Then, the question is whose \ndesire will be calmed: the grahastha or the sãnkhya-yogi?  When \nreplying, keep in mind that the Veds state: ‘Only a person who has \nintense vairãgya should become a tyãgi from the brahm-chãrya \nãshram; whereas a person whose vairãgya is feeble should become a \ngrahastha for the purpose of diminishing his intense desire to indulge \nin the vishays.  Only then should he accept the vãnprasth ãshram, and \nthen the sannyãs ashram’.  Therefore, answer carefully.” \n \n29.3 Shuk Muni attempted to answer the question but was unable to do so \nsatisfactorily. \n \n29.4 Answering the question Himself, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The \ngrahastha is good, and the other who is a sãnkhya-yogi is bad.  This is \nbecause he lacks intense vairãgya.  As a result, he does not realise \nthat the vishays are worthless and false.  Also, for the same reason, he \nhas no firmness in his ãtmã-nishthã.  For this reason, if he happens to \nleave satsang and encounter vishays, he will become attached to \nGADHADÃ III \n- 755 - \nthem.  However, if he does not come across vishays, he will be \ncompelled to come back into satsang.  On the other hand, the \ngrahastha will progress even if he has the darshan of a sãdhu once \nevery six months.  Therefore, it is not appropriate for a person who is \ndeficient in vairãgya to become a tyãgi; it is only appropriate for \nsomeone who has intense vairãgya.  If someone who is deficient in \nvairãgya does become a tyãgi, then his tyãg will not continue \nthroughout his life.  After one year, two years, or after even ten years, \ndifficulties will definitely arise in his tyãg.” \n \n29.5 Then, Shuk Muni raised a doubt.  He questioned, “Mahãrãj, if the \nperson whose vairãgya is weak listens to the greatness of Bhagvãn \nfrom a sãdhu and thinks over it in his mind, then will he not develop \nintense vairãgya?  In fact, only very few people, due to their \nprãrabdha, have intense vairãgya from the beginning.  Generally, we \nsee that a person develops vairãgya even though he did not possess it \ninitially.  How should this be understood?” \n \n29.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “The answer to that is that a person can \nnever develop intense vairãgya merely by thinking by himself, or by \nany other means for that matter.  However, if a person develops love \nfor a great sant who possesses the four qualities of dharma, gnãn, \nvairãgya, and bhakti, then all the actions he performs (seeing, \nlistening, talking) will be performed according to the wishes of that \ngreat sant; he will not do anything which is against the sant’s wish.  In \nhis mind, he constantly fears behaving against the wishes of that sant, \nand feels, ‘If I do not behave according to his wish, then he will not \nmaintain love for me’.  That is why such a person will constantly \nbehave according to the sant’s wishes.  Therefore, if someone has \ndeveloped such attachment for a sant, then even if he does not have \nvairãgya, his tyãg will remain till the end. \n \n29.7 “In our satsang, all the males, females, and paramhans, are attached \nto me.  Also, all the females observe vartmãns to the same extent as \nthe three senior females (Lãdu-Bã, Jeevu-Bã, and Rãj-Bãi).  This is \nGADHADÃ III \n- 756 - \nbecause in their mind, they realise, ‘If we do not remain alert and \nobserve the vartmãns, the love which Mahãrãj has for us will not \nremain, and He will become unhappy’.  The paramhans also behave in \nthe same way.  In fact, it is the same for all the other satsangis, \nbrahm-chãris and pãrshads.  All the male and female bhaktas living \nfar and wide are also alert in observing the vartmãns; they too feel, ‘If \nwe do not behave properly, Mahãrãj will become displeased.’  \nTherefore, all of them strictly observe dharma out of love for me, \neven though they may possess vairãgya to a greater or lesser degree. \n \n29.8 “However, when I recently fell ill in Panchãlã, if something serious \nhad happened to me, then everyone’s firmness would not have \nremained as it is now.  At such a time, a person who has intense \nvairãgya can remain within dharma; or a person who has lovingly \nattached his jeev to a person who has intense vairãgya can remain \nwithin dharma; or a person who keeps contact with satsang and, \nrealising Bhagvãn to be antaryãmi, behaves according to the niyams \nthat have been prescribed for him, can remain within dharma.  \nExcept for these, others cannot remain within dharma.  Therefore, \nwhat I have just explained is the only answer to the question I had \nasked.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 29 || 263 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 30 \nConstant Awareness Of Five Thoughts \n \n30.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Posh sud Punam [19th January 1829], \nSwãmi Shree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in the mandir of Shree \nGopinãthji in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n30.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Two beliefs which I like, and by which \nmy mind becomes calm, are as follows:  First, I like a person who is \nGADHADÃ III \n- 757 - \nfirmly convinced that there is a mass of divine light which is \nchaitanya, and that the murti of Shree Purushottam Bhagvãn forever \nresides at the centre of that mass of light; and with that belief, he \nworships and offers bhakti to that Bhagvãn.  On the other hand, I do \nnot like a person who believes in and worships only the chaitanya \ndivine light; nor do I like a person who does not believe Bhagvãn to \nforever possess a svarup; nor do I like a person who does not \nworship Bhagvãn.  Secondly, I like a person who performs in tap, and \nyog, has vairãgya and hatred towards the panch-vishays, in order to \nplease Bhagvãn – without any form of pretence.  Seeing such a \nperson, my mind becomes pleased, and I feel, ‘He should be \ncongratulated for behaving in that way’. \n \n30.3 “In addition, I have constant awareness of these five thoughts:  First, I \nam certainly going to die and leave this body.  In fact, I firmly feel, ‘I \nam going to die at this second, at this very moment’.  Such awareness \nremains in times of happiness and distress, pleasure and displeasure, \nand amidst all activities.  That is the type of vairãgya I possess.  The \nsecond thought is the constant awareness that even though death is \ncertain, this much work is left, which I would like to complete.  The \nthird is thought of whether or not desires for the panch-vishays have \nbeen eradicated from my mind. I feel, ‘If they have been eradicated, \nthen why does activity regarding that vishay still occur?  What if maybe \nthey have not been eradicated?’  In this way, I am constantly \nsuspicious of the mind.  The fourth thought is the concern of whether \nor not Muktãnand Swãmi and the other senior sãdhus and senior \nbhaktas have eradicated their desires for the panch-vishays.  In fact, I \nam constantly aware of looking into everyone’s hearts to observe, \n‘This person’s worldly desires have been removed, but this person’s \nhave not’.  Finally, the fifth thought is that if I become unhappy, then \nwho knows where I would run away to!  I would probably leave my \nbody.  Therefore, I believe I should not become unhappy.  This is \nbecause it is good that by my association all these men, women, and \nparamhans happily sit to engage in the bhakti of Bhagvãn.  Seeing \nthem engaged in such bhakti, I become extremely pleased in my \nGADHADÃ III \n- 758 - \nmind.  I feel, ‘Everyone must die someday, but to perform bhakti in this \nway is the only great benefit of living’.  I am constantly aware of this.” \n \n30.4 In this way, Shreeji Mahãrãj described His own behaviour as an \nexample for the benefit of His bhaktas, while in actual fact, He \nHimself is the pratyaksha svarup of Shree Purushottam Nãrãyan. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 30 || 264 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 31 \nThe Murti On Earth And The Murti In Akshardhãm \n \n31.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on the evening of Mahã sud 4 [7th February \n1829], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the \nveranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He had tied a white feto around His head and was wearing \na white khes.  He had also covered Himself with a red-bordered, \nwhite, English cloth.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him.  Some of the \nparamhans were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of musical \ninstruments.  \n \n31.2 After the paramhans sang the kirtan ‘Hari Mere Hãralaki Lakari...’, \nShreeji Mahãrãj requested, “Please sing ‘Jamunã Ke Teer Thãdo...’.”  \nThe paramhans then began singing that kirtan.  In the meantime, \nShreeji Mahãrãj sat thinking. \n \n31.3 Then, He interrupted, “Please stop singing, and allow me to talk to \nyou.  What I am about to reveal to you is not much, but it can be very \nbeneficial for those who practice dhyãn.  In fact, I have never revealed \nthis matter before.”  Then, closing His gentle eyes, He began thinking, \nand then said, “There is a mass of divine light that is like countless \nmillions of moons, suns, and flames of fire.  That mass of light \nappears to be like an ocean.  The svarup of Purushottam Bhagvãn \nresides within that luminous, brahm-rup dhãm of Bhagvãn, and He \nHimself assumes an avatãr from that murti. \nGADHADÃ III \n- 759 - \n31.4 “What is that Bhagvãn like?  Well, He is greater than both the \nperishable and the imperishable; He is the cause of all causes; and \ncountless millions of akshar-rup muktas worship His holy feet.  Out of \ncompassion, that very same Bhagvãn is pratyaksha and present \nbefore your eyes in an incarnated murti for the purpose of granting \nultimate kalyãn of jeevs.  Therefore, there is a great similarity \nbetween the murti residing in the dhãm of Bhagvãn and this \npratyaksha murti of Shree Krishna. \n \n31.5 “The vision of a person who performs dhyãn on this human murti of \nShree Krishna develops extreme vairãgya for all charming sights \nother than Bhagvãn and remains engrossed only in the charm of \nBhagvãn.  Then, he does not notice even the slightest difference \nbetween the pratyaksha murti of Bhagvãn and the murti in His dhãm.  \nThe appearance and age of that murti, and the appearance and age of \nthis murti will appear similar.  In addition, the height and build of \nthat murti will appear to be exactly the same as that of this murti; not \neven the slightest difference can be perceived between that murti \nand this murti.  Also, there appears to be a total oneness between \nthem.  In this way, there is not even the slightest difference between \nthat murti and this murti.  In fact, both are one. \n \n31.6 “When a person performs dhyãn on that pratyaksha murti outwardly, \nin front of the eyes, there is not the slightest difference between that \nmurti and this murti.  However, if he looks at that same murti \ninwardly, within his eyes, then that same murti does not appear to be \nthe same as before.  In this case, it becomes the same size as the pupil \nof the eye.  Then, when he performs dhyãn and looks inward at the \npoint of his throat and below, he does not see that same murti as the \ntwo murtis he saw before.  He sees that same murti as being \nextremely large, extremely tall, extremely fat, and extremely \nfrightening.  For example, the shadow of a man formed by the sun at \nnoon would be almost the same length as the man’s body.  But when \nthat same sun sets, the shadow becomes very elongated – it does not \nremain the same length as the man’s body.  Similarly, the murti of \nGADHADÃ III \n- 760 - \nBhagvãn also becomes as large as mentioned previously.  Then, when \nthe person sees that murti within the buddhi, which resides in the \nheart, and when he sees that murti within his own jeev within the \nbuddhi, he sees the murti as being the size of a thumb.  It appears to \nhave two arms or four arms, but he does not see it in the three ways \nthat he saw before.  Then, while performing dhyãn, he sees the murti \nto be greater than his jeev and sees it in the midst of a mass of divine \nlight which is like that of countless millions of suns, moons, and \nflames of fire.  Also, he sees that murti to be just like the murti that he \nsaw before his eyes; he does not perceive even the slightest \ndifference between the two. \n \n31.7 “Therefore, the same murti that is in Akshardhãm – which is gunãtit – \nis pratyaksha.  There is no difference between the two.  Just as the \nmurti in the dhãm is gunãtit, the human murti is also gunãtit.  The \ndifference which was noticed earlier was due to the gun of the \ndifferent locations within the body – in the eyes there is sattva-gun; \nin the throat there is rajo-gun; even the jeev, which resides within the \nbuddhi, is full of gun.” \n \n31.8 After delivering this talk, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Please continue \nsinging the kirtan which you were singing earlier.” \n \n31.9 In this way, Shreeji Mahãrãj revealed Himself as Purushottam using \nthe non-pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvãn as an example. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 31 || 266 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 32 \nCommitting Sins Under The Excuse Of Bhagvãn’s Greatness \n \n32.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Mahã sud 5 [8th February 1829], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on \nthe veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr \nin Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of \nGADHADÃ III \n- 761 - \nmunis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him.

The longing subsides when \nhis vision reaches Bhagvãn’s. \n \n32.3 The sãdhus then explained the shlok according to the commentary \nwritten by Rãmãnuj Ãchãrya. \n \n32.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then added, “With reference to that shlok, I have \nformed the belief that a person who is in his youth should reduce his \ndiet and should eat and behave moderately.  When a person’s diet is \nreduced, physical strength also diminishes.  Only then can the \nindriyas be overcome; otherwise they cannot.  Having done that, if a \nperson enthusiastically engages his mind in the nine types of bhakti \nof Bhagvãn, and himself lovingly engages in bhakti, then he will \nremain in satsang till the end.  But, if he does not behave in this way, \nhe will surely surrender to his indriyas and, sooner or later, he will \nfall from satsang.  Even a person who has mastered samãdhi, like \nSheth Govardhan, is afraid of this; so what can be said for others? \n \n32.5 ”However, a person’s diet cannot be controlled by merely observing \nseveral upvãs consecutively.  This only leads to his desires and diet \nincreasing, because when he breaks an upvãs, he tends to eat twice as \nmuch.  However, if a person begins to reduce his diet gradually, it can \nbe controlled.  For example, even though the clouds cause rain to fall \nin tiny drops, water still collects in a large quantity.  Similarly, a \nperson should control his diet gradually.  As a result, his indriyas will \nalso be controlled.  Then, if he lovingly engages in bhakti, he will \nremain in satsang till the end.  This is a fact.” \nGADHADÃ III \n- 762 - \n32.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “How does a true bhakta of Bhagvãn \nunderstand Bhagvãn’s greatness?  Well, he believes, ‘Bhagvãn, who \npossesses a definite murti, forever resides in His luminous Akshardhãm.  \nHe is the cause and controller of everything, the antaryãmi within all \nand the supreme lord of countless millions of brahmãnds.  Moreover, \nHis murti is divine, blissful, and free from the gun of Mãyã’.  \nUnderstanding the pratyaksha Bhagvãn in this way, he believes that \nwith the exception of Bhagvãn, all other worldly objects are \nabsolutely worthless and perishable.  In addition, he has love only for \nBhagvãn, and he engages in the nine types of bhakti.  He also believes, \n‘Kãl, Mãyã, Brahmã, Shiv, Surya, and Chandra, are powerful, yet even \nthey act according to the niyams of that extremely great Bhagvãn’.  \nUnderstanding this, he always behaves within the niyams of dharma \nestablished by Bhagvãn in order to please Him; he never disobeys \nthose niyams. \n \n32.7 “On the other hand, a person who has a corrupted mind believes, \n‘Such a great Bhagvãn is patit-pãvan and adham-udhãran.  So, why \nworry about slightly disobeying the niyam of dharma?  After all, \nBhagvãn is capable of granting kalyãn’.  In this way, he does not \nhesitate in committing sins under the pretext of knowing Bhagvãn’s \ngreatness.  Such a person should be considered wicked and sinful.  \nAlso, even though he may superficially appear to be a bhakta, he \nshould not be considered a bhakta, and a person should not remain \nin his company.  Only a person who has the understanding described \npreviously should be considered to be a bhakta, and only his \ncompany should be kept.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 32 || 266 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 33 \nAll Are Affected By Wealth And Women \n \n33.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Fãgan sud 11 [16th March 1829], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in the mandir of Shree \nGADHADÃ III \n- 763 - \nGopinãthji in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n33.2 Then, addressing all the paramhans, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “In satsang, \nthere are only a few bhaktas whose mind would not be affected by \nwealth, property, women, and children, and who would not develop \nfaith in those who fulfil the desires related to those things.  In fact, \nthere cannot be many bhaktas who are like this.”  Saying this, Shreeji \nMahãrãj continued, “This Muktãnand Swãmi and Gopãlãnand Swãmi \nare like that, because in no way would they become impressed by \nanyone, no matter how great he may be, and not even if he were to \nperform miracles. \n \n33.3 “What are the characteristics of a person who will not be influenced \nby anyone?  Well, such a person believes, ‘I am the ãtmã, which is \ndistinct from the body; I am luminous and eternal.  Moreover, the \npratyaksha svarup of Bhagvãn constantly resides within my own self.  \nExcept for the svarup of Bhagvãn, all worldly svarups are asatya and \nfull of countless flaws’.  A person who has such vairãgya and who \nthoroughly understands the greatness of Bhagvãn will never have \nany kind of doubts in his mind.  But having said that, this \nunderstanding is very difficult to develop. \n \n33.4 “Even though these two sãdhus are so great, if they were to receive a \ngreat amount of honour, or if heaps of rupees and gold coins were to \nbe placed before them, or if they were to come across attractive \nwomen, then even though they are tyãgis, they would not be able to \nmaintain their dharma.  In fact, if they do encounter those objects, \nthen it is doubtful whether they would remain equal with even the \nlowest of our tyãgis.  This is because that is effect of the association of \nthose objects.  For example, see how religious all of us sitting here \nare.  However, if we were to drink bottles of liquor, we would not \nremain so composed.  Similarly, the association of those objects \ncertainly has an effect on a person.  Therefore, a person can only be \nGADHADÃ III \n- 764 - \nsaved from those objects if he does not associate with them.  He \nshould be cautious from the beginning, in case he comes across them.  \nMoreover, it is a well-known fact of the shãstras that only Bhagvãn is \nunaffected by their association.  That is why it has been stated:  \n \nrushim nãrãyanam-rute... \nOf the progeny of Brahmã (Marichi), and their progeny (Kashyap), and their \nprogeny (humans and devs) – whose mind in this world, besides that of \nNãrãyan Rushi, can be distinguished as being unaffected by the mãyã and \nattractive charm of women? \n \n... ye-nye svataha parihrutãd-api bibhyati sma \nO Master of the indriyas (Bhagvãn)!  You are indeed the lord of the whole \nmobile and immobile world, because even though you indulge in the various \nsense objects created by the imbalance in the gun of Mãyã, you remain \nunaffected by them.  Apart from you, others still fear the association of the \nsense objects – even though they have renounced them. \n \n33.5 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Who can be called an ekãntik bhakta of \nBhagvãn?  Well, a person who possesses the qualities of svadharma, \ngnãn, vairãgya, and unparalleled bhakti towards Bhagvãn coupled \nwith knowledge of his greatness, can be called an ekãntik bhakta. \n \n33.6 “Furthermore, regarding the ultimate fate of an ekãntik bhakta, it is \nsaid the he ‘enters’ Bhagvãn.  But what is meant by ‘entering’?  Well, \nthat bhakta has love for the divya murti of Bhagvãn, who dwells \nwithin a mass of divine light.  Due to that love, he has constant \nawareness of the murti of Bhagvãn in his mind, and he behaves as if \nhe is infatuated by that murti.  Remaining in that state, he also \nengages in the service of Bhagvãn outwardly.  For example, even \nthough Lakshmiji remains in the heart of Bhagvãn symbolically and \nthrough her profound love, she also outwardly serves him in the \nsvarup of a female.  The ‘entering’ of an ekãntik bhakta into Bhagvãn \nshould be understood in a similar way. \n \n33.7 “Even at present, the attachment a bhakta has for the ten types of \nbhakti as well as the attachment he has for svadharma, vairãgya, \nGADHADÃ III \n- 765 - \nãtmã-nishthã, keeping the company of a sant and realising the \ngreatness of Bhagvãn is such that he can in no way do without it.  \nEven though opium is extremely bitter, a person who is addicted to it \ncannot live without it.  Or, if a person is addicted to alcohol, then even \nthough his throat burns whenever he drinks alcohol, he cannot live \nwithout it.  Even if someone were to offer him many rupees he would \nnot accept them, because his addiction is dearer to him.  This is \nbecause that addiction has become ingrained in his jeev.  Similarly, if \na person was addicted to the bhakti of Bhagvãn and other such \nactivities, then even if he remains under the influence of any type of \nkusang, he would not be able to live without engaging in bhakti.  \nMoreover, his mind would not be pleased in engaging in any other \nactivities.  Such a bhakta of Bhagvãn, whose jeev has become \nengrossed in Bhagvãn’s bhakti and other such activities, and who is \nextremely eager to perform only those activities, can also be said to \nhave ‘entered’ Bhagvãn. \n \n33.8 “So, what are the characteristics of such a bhakta of Bhagvãn?  Well, \nexcept for the sevã of Bhagvãn, if he does not wish for even the four \ntypes of mukti, how can he desire anything else?  Such a person \nshould be known as an ekãntik bhakta because he has no desire for \nanything.  A person who is not like this sometimes enjoys engaging in \nthe bhakti of Bhagvãn’s; but if he encounters evil company, he will \nforget bhakti and begin to behave immorally.  Such a person should \nbe known to be a fake bhakta and a person who believes himself to \nbe the body.  He is not a true bhakta and cannot be trusted.” \n \n33.9 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj continued, “If a bhakta of Bhagvãn is \nvulnerable to women, wealth, svabhãvs, and the belief that he is the \nbody, then even if he is engaged in the bhakti of Bhagvãn, his bhakti \ncannot be trusted; he will surely encounter obstacles in it.  This is \nbecause if at some time he happens to come across women or wealth, \nthen there will be no stability in his bhakti, and he will become \nengrossed in them.  Also, if a person believes himself to be the body, \nthen when he suffers due to some illness, or if he is unable to obtain \nGADHADÃ III \n- 766 - \nfood and clothing, or if a ãgnã to observe a difficult vartmãn is given, \nthen again, his bhakti will be disturbed.  In fact, he will become \nfrustrated and will not be able to think; he will begin to behave \nimmorally.  Also, if he has a certain svabhãv, and if a sant lectures him \ninstead of allowing him to behave according to his svabhãv, and \nmakes him behave opposite to it, then also he will become disturbed.  \nThen, if he cannot remain in the company of a sant, how will he be \nable to maintain bhakti?  Therefore, a person who wishes to develop \nfirm bhakti should not be vulnerable in these four aspects.  If there is \na flaw in these four, it should be slowly eradicated with \nunderstanding.  Only then can a person perform constant bhakti of \nBhagvãn.  What I have just said is absolutely true; there is no doubt in \nit whatsoever.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 33 || 267 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 34 \nMaintaining Desires Only For Bhagvãn’s \nExpressing Anger At Those Who Disobey The Niyams Of Dharma \n \n34.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Chaitra sud 3 [6th April 1829], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in the mandir of Shree \nGopinãthji in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n34.2 Then, Shuk Muni asked Shreeji Mahãrãj, “There appear to be two \nmeans by which desires for only Bhagvãn remain, and desires for any \nworldly object do not remain.  One is love for Bhagvãn, and other is \nvairãgya coupled with gnãn.  These are the two means.  For a person \nwho does not practise these two means firmly, but who does have \nnishchay in Bhagvãn and the belief of Bhagvãn, is there a third means \nby which he can maintain desires only for Bhagvãn and not for \nanything else?” \nGADHADÃ III \n- 767 - \n34.3 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said in reply, “That is a good question because \nit is true that only by those two means do desires only for Bhagvãn \nremain, and desires for any worldly object do not remain.  If a person \ndoes not practice those two means, then his desires for objects other \nthan Bhagvãn will not be eradicated.  As a result, he remains unhappy \nin life.  But, since he has nishchay in Bhagvãn, he will be granted \nkalyãn by Bhagvãn after death. \n \n34.4 “However, just like those two means, there is also a third means for \neradicating desires for objects other than Bhagvãn.  What is it?  Well, \nit is to vigilantly observe the prescribed niyams.  What are those \nniyams?  Some are svadharma niyams, that are related to the duties of \na person’s varna and ashram.  Just as there are niyams for an ãtmã-\nnivedi sãdhu and a brahm-chãri, similarly, even though a person is not \nan ãtmã-nivedi, he should still follow the niyams of not seeing women \nand not listening to talks about them.  In this way, he should strictly \nand attentively observe the niyams related to abandoning the panch-\nvishays.  Also, he should physically serve Bhagvãn and His bhaktas, \nand he should listen to kathãs related to Bhagvãn.  In this way, if he \nobserves niyams in the form of engaging in the nine types of bhakti, \nthen his mind will also begin to think about good thoughts.  So, if a \nperson behaves according to these two niyams, then as a result, even \nif he does not have vairãgya or love for Bhagvãn, they will develop; \nhe will become extremely powerful; impure desires for objects will \nbe eradicated; and only desires for Bhagvãn will flourish day by day.” \n \n34.5 Again, Shuk Muni asked, “Mahãrãj, it seems krodh arises when a \nperson’s desire for a certain object or his sense of ‘my-ness’ for \nsomething is violated by someone.  When a desire, such as a craving, \nis not satisfied, then that desire results in krodh.  So, it can be said \nthat such a person has developed a svabhãv in which krodh can arise.  \nIs it possible that krodh will not arise even in such situations?” \n \n34.6 Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “A great sant, due to Bhagvãn’s ãgnã or by \nhis own wish after understanding Bhagvãn’s greatness according to \nGADHADÃ III \n- 768 - \nthe shãstras, may have made a firm decision to keep countless people \nwithin the niyams of dharma, and to lead them onto the path of \nBhagvãn.  This sant may express anger on a person who disobeys the \nniyam of dharma and follows adharma.  If the sant does not express \nanger and does not lecture that person in order to teach him to \nremain within the niyams of dharma, then that person will continue \nto disobey those niyams and will not progress.  Therefore, anger \nexpressed for this reason is beneficial; there is nothing unsuitable \nabout it.  This is because thousands of people have taken refuge of \nthe great sant who has chosen to take this path.  So, how can they \npossibly not be slightly lectured? \n \n34.7 “However, anger will not arise if a person avoids the very cause of \nthat anger.  Obviously, anger will not arise, if a person is travelling \nalone in the jungle; but how can a great sant do that?  After all, he has \nunderstood from the shãstras the great rewards involved in guiding \ncountless people towards Bhagvãn by talks, in order that they attain \nkalyãn.  Similarly, he has also understood the importance of \nobserving Bhagvãn’s ãgnã.  Therefore, even though he may express \nanger, he still does not abandon his decision to lead people to kalyãn. \n \n34.8 A person who has developed attachment with a great sant, has \nunderstood that his personal interest of attaining kalyãn can be \nfulfilled by the sant.  Also, he believes, ‘I can only attain kalyãn \nthrough this sant’. Then, even though he may have the svabhãv of \nkrodh, he will never express that krodh on that great sant.  In fact, he \nwill surely abandon his svabhãv.  So, krodh can also be eradicated in \nthis way. \n \n34.9 “On the other hand, a person who becomes angry on a sant over the \nexchange of some worthless objects has simply not understood the \ngreatness of the sant, or the true path of a sant.  If he had understood \nit, then he would not become angry over such worthless objects.  \nEven if such a person is intelligent and understanding, if he does \nbecome angry on a sant for worthless objects, then his intellect \nGADHADÃ III \n- 769 - \nshould be considered to be like that of a king’s minister – skilled only \nin worldly affairs.  He does not possess the intellect of sant.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 34 || 268 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 35 \nForcefully Altering Svabhãv \nBhagvãn Is Insulted When His Bhakta Is Insulted \n \n35.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Chaitra sud 9 [12th April 1829], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in the mandir of Shree \nGopinãthji in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of sãdhus, as well as haribhaktas \nfrom various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n35.2 Then, Shuk Muni asked, “Mahãrãj, how can we recognise that a \nperson has such a firm refuge of Bhagvãn and His bhaktas that it will \nnot falter in any way – regardless of the extent of suffering he may \nhave to face; regardless of any physical happiness or distress; and \nregardless of whether he faces honour or insult, or even unpleasant \ncircumstances?  Please also describe what type of thoughts such a \nperson has in mind, as well as how he behaves physically?” \n \n35.3 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said in reply, “If a bhakta realises that only \nBhagvãn is great, but he does not believe anything else to be greater \nthan Bhagvãn; and if he also believes that everything except Bhagvãn \nis worthless; and if he does not become disturbed or annoyed when \nBhagvãn or His sant attempts to forcefully alter his svabhãv or when \nthey do not allow him to behave according to his svabhãv; and if he \ncan abandon his svabhãv, no matter how embedded it may be, and \nfollow the ãgnã of Bhagvãn and His sant in a simple way – then that \nbhakta’s acceptance of the refuge of Bhagvãn will not falter, \nregardless of how difficult the circumstances may be.” \nGADHADÃ III \n- 770 - \n35.4 Shuk Muni then queried, “Such a person must become disturbed, \nbecause when someone’s svabhãv is forcefully altered, he naturally \nbecomes disturbed.  So, are there differences in the types of \ndisturbances that are experienced or not?” \n \n35.5 Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “If a person is disturbed when his nature \nis forcefully altered, and if he then finds avgun within himself rather \nthan with Bhagvãn or His sant, then he is good.  However, instead of \nfinding faults with himself, if a person perceives avgun in Bhagvãn \nand His sant, then his future is uncertain, and there is no stability in \nhis refuge of Bhagvãn.” \n \n35.6 Again, Shuk Muni asked, “If Bhagvãn or His sant have never \nattempted to twist a person’s nature, how can he realise in his own \nmind, ‘If they do attempt to do so at some time in the future, I will \nbecome disturbed’.  After all, how can a person be sure of something \nthat he has not experienced?” \n \n35.7 Hearing this, Shreeji Mahãrãj explained, “A person should think about \nthe thoughts that occur in his mind.  For example, ‘In the mind, \nbesides the thoughts of Bhagvãn, there are also thoughts related to the \npanch-vishays.  Of these, for which objects do I have powerful desires \nand for which do I have strong cravings?’  If a person thinks in this \nway, he can realise himself as he truly is; otherwise, he cannot.  \nDuring the thinking of those thoughts, he should also realise, ‘I have \nvery strong desires for this object, and I am striving to attain it.  \nHowever, when a sant attempts to have me abandon it, I will become \ndisturbed’.  In this way, he becomes clear about his own self.  If his \nsvabhãv is stubborn, and Bhagvãn or His sant do not attempt to alter \nit, then he will survive in satsang.  However, if they do attempt to \nalter it, then he will definitely fall.  Ultimately, he will become \nextremely disturbed and will fall from satsang.” \n \n35.8 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “The shãstras claim that to insult a sant is \nthe greatest of all sins.  What is the reason for this?  Well, it is because \nShree Krishna Bhagvãn Himself resides in the heart of that sant.  \nGADHADÃ III \n- 771 - \nTherefore, when a person insults a sant, he insults Bhagvãn as well.  \nAfter all, when a person insults a sant, Bhagvãn, who resides within \nhis heart, is hurt.  In such a case, the sin of insulting Bhagvãn is an \neven greater sin.  Therefore, it is said that to insult the sant is the \ngreatest of all sins. \n \n35.9 “Having said that though, Kans, Shishupãl, Putnã, and other demons \ninsulted Bhagvãn, yet Bhagvãn still granted them kalyãn like that of a \nbhakta.  This is because even though it was out of hatred, those \ndemons did think about Bhagvãn.  So, Bhagvãn felt, ‘Those demons \nthought of me, and therefore associated with me, even though it was \nout of hatred.  So, I should grant them kalyãn’.  These cases should be \ntaken as examples of Bhagvãn’s compassion.  A person should also \nrealise, ‘If Bhagvãn granted them kalyãn even though they sought the \nrefuge of Bhagvãn through hatred, why would Bhagvãn not grant \nkalyãn to a bhakta who seeks His refuge by offering bhakti and who \npleases Him by that bhakti?  Of course, He will’. \n \n35.10 “The intention of those who have written the shãstras is to inspire \npeople towards the bhakti of Bhagvãn by showing Bhagvãn’s great \ncompassion; their intention was not to allow people to behave \nagainst Bhagvãn’s wishes like the demons.  Therefore, a person who \nspites Bhagvãn by keeping hatred towards Him and who behaves \nagainst His wishes should definitely be considered to be a demon – \nbecause that is the way of demons.  However, a person should behave \nonly in a way that will please Bhagvãn; he should engage in bhakti \nand please Him and His bhaktas.  That is the way of the bhaktas of \nBhagvãn.” \n \n35.11 Shuk Muni then asked further, “Mahãrãj, what are the characteristics \nof a sant who is such that by insulting him, Bhagvãn residing within \nhis heart is also insulted, and by performing his sevã, Bhagvãn’s sevã \nis also performed?” \n \n35.12 Shreeji Mahãrãj thought for a while and then answered out of \ncompassion:  “First of all, the most important characteristic is that he \nGADHADÃ III \n- 772 - \nnever believes Bhagvãn to be nirãkãr.  He understands Bhagvãn to \neternally sãkãr.  No matter how many of the Purãns, Upanishads, \nVeds, or other shãstras he may hear – if ever he comes across the idea \nof Bhagvãn being nirãkãr, he thinks, ‘Either I have not understood the \ntrue meaning of the shãstras, or there may be other purpose behind \nsuch words; but Bhagvãn is always sãkãr’.  If he does not understand \nBhagvãn be sãkãr, then his upãsanã cannot be considered to be firm.  \nAlso, if Bhagvãn is nirãkãr, then He could not be called the all-doer – \njust as ãkãsh cannot be called the doer; and nor could He be said to \nreside in one location.  Therefore, Bhagvãn is eternally sãkãr.  In \naddition, He is the creator, sustainer, and destroyer of countless \nbrahmãnds; He is forever present in His Akshardhãm; He is the lord of \nall; and He is pratyaksha here before your eyes.  The sant mentioned \nabove always has this understanding; but this understanding of his is \nnever shaken in any way or under any circumstances. \n \n35.13 “Secondly, he engages himself in the ekãntik bhakti of Bhagvãn.  \nMoreover, when he sees someone else engaged in kathãs, singing \nkirtans, and chanting the holy name of Bhagvãn, he becomes \nextremely pleased in his mind. \n \n35.14 “Thirdly, when he stays amongst bhaktas, he does not allow any of \nhis svabhãvs to interfere.  In fact, he will abandon his svabhãvs, but he \nwill not leave the company of the bhaktas of Bhagvãn.  If a sant \nhappens to criticise his svabhãvs, he does not have hatred towards \nthe sant.  Instead, he finds faults with his own svabhãvs, but he never \nbecomes upset or even thinks of departing from the company of the \nbhaktas of Bhagvãn.  In this way, he remains within the company of \nbhaktas. \n \n35.15 “Fourthly, when he comes across any precious item, such as an \nexpensive piece of clothing, some delicious food, or clean water, ‘It \nwould be nice to give this to a bhakta of Bhagvãn’.  He would give \naway the items to him and be happy. \nGADHADÃ III \n- 773 - \n35.16 “Fifth, the bhaktas in whose company he is staying do not feel, ‘He has \nbeeen staying with us for so many years, yet we have not been able to \ntruly understand him; and who knows what he is really like?  It is \ndifficult to judge him’.  He would not be like that.  Instead, he would \nbe such that everyone would know him outwardly and inwardly, and \nthey would feel, ‘He is definitely like this’.  He would be of such an \nhonest nature. \n \n35.17 “Sixth, even if he is of a quiet nature, he would not like the company \nof kusangis; and if he does happen to come across them, he would \nbecome angry.  In this way, he has a natural dislike for the company \nof those who are vimukhs.   \n \n35.18 “Therefore, it should be known that Bhagvãn Himself resides in the \nheart of a sant who possesses these six qualities.  By insulting such a \nsant, a person commits a sin equivalent to insulting Bhagvãn; and if \nhe performs sevã of such a sant, he earns rewards equivalent to \nperforming sevã of Bhagvãn.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 35 || 269 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 36 \nThe Most Extraordinary Spiritual Activity For Kalyãn \nThe Company Of A Shushka-Vedãnti \n \n36.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Vaishãkh sud 1 [4th May 1829], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj rode on horseback from Dãdã Khãchar’s \ndarbãr in Gadhadã and arrived at Lakshmi-Vãdi.

Please answer both of these questions.” \n \n36.3 Everyone answered according to their understanding, but the \nquestion was not answered satisfactorily. \n \n36.4 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said in reply, “The most extraordinary spiritual \nactivity is to understand Purushottam Bhagvãn, who is seated amidst \nthe mass of light of Brahm, as eternally having a svarup.  \nFurthermore, after understanding that all avatãrs originate from \nHim, a person should accept the refuge of the pratyaksha svarup of \nBhagvãn by any means possible.  He should also offer bhakti to that \nBhagvãn while observing dharma, as well as associate with a sant \npossessing such bhakti.  That is the most extraordinary spiritual \nactivity for kalyãn.  A person encounters no obstacles along that path. \n \n36.5 “A major obstacle in practising that spiritual activity is keeping the \ncompany of shushka-vedãntis.  Which obstacles arise when a person \nkeeps their company?  Initially, he develops affection for them.  That \naffection develops due to the kindness of the vedãntis.  For example, \nif a person has saved someone’s life by giving him some food during a \nfamine, then that person would naturally develop affection for him.  \nIn this way, a person develops affection for a person who has helped \nhim.  Also, those shushka-vedãntis would point out advantages, such \nas, ‘The ãtmã does not undergo births and deaths, and it is formless.  In \nfact, regardless of the number of sins a person may commit, the ãtmã \nremains immune to those flaws’.  Pointing out such advantages, they \ncriticise the svarup of Bhagvãn.  That is a major obstacle since it leads \nto the rejection of Bhagvãn’s svarup.  Therefore, a person should \nnever keep the company of shushka-vedãntis – they are absolutely \nignorant.  In fact, there is no greater obstacle on the path of bhakti \nthan this.” \n \n36.6 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj returned to Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr.  There, He \nsat on a large decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-\nGADHADÃ III \n- 775 - \nfacing rooms and said, “I have heard all the shãstras and have formed \na principle.  I have also travelled throughout this land and seen many \nyogis.”  Shreeji Mahãrãj then narrated the stories of Gopãldãsji and \nother sãdhus.  He then continued by saying, “I believe that it is \nimpossible to see the ãtmã and brahm without the upãsanã and \ndhyãn of Bhagvãn’s murti.  Only through upãsanã can the ãtmã and \nbrahm be seen; without it, they cannot be seen.  In fact, wishing to see \nthe ãtmã and brahm without upãsanã is like attempting to lick the \nsky with the tongue; even if a person tries for a hundred years, he \nwill never be able to taste it as sour or salty.  Similarly, the ãtmã and \nbrahm simply cannot be seen without the upãsanã of the murti of \nBhagvãn – regardless of the efforts a person may resort to.  \nFurthermore, the fact that the shãstras mention the possibility of \nãtmã-nishthã through nirbij Sãnkhya and Yog is irrelevant – I have \nnot seen anyone do so, nor is the claim in agreement with my \nexperience.  Therefore, the claim is false.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 36 || 270 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 37 \nThe Happiness Of Bhagvãn Is Never Forgotten \n \n37.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Vaishãkh sud 3 [6th May 1829], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting on a square cushion on the \nveranda outside the north-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in \nGadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of \nparamhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered \nbefore Him. \n \n37.2 Then, addressing all the sãdhus and bhaktas, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, \n“Once a person has thoroughly attained the gnãn of Bhagvãn, then \neven if the factors of desh, kãl, kriyã, and sang become unpleasant for \nhim, his gnãn does not diminish in the least.  For example, take the \nanalogy of a great king or a millionaire.  If he happens to lose his \nGADHADÃ III \n- 776 - \nstatus due to his prãrabdha and becomes poor, and because of that if \nhe has only cheap food to eat, such as low-quality grains, or spinach, \nor moss, or berries, or boiled pipal fruit, then he would certainly eat \nit; but he would also recall the expensive foods that he formerly \nobtained and ate.  In his mind he would think, ‘I used to eat all those \ndelicious foods in the past, whereas now I eat such common food’.  In \nthis way, whenever he eats, he would recall this.  However, if a \nperson has been eating such common food from the beginning, and if \nhe becomes even poorer, then he continues to eat the same type of \nfood as before.  So, what does he have to recall?  Nothing. \n \n37.3 “So, once a person has thoroughly known the bliss of Bhagvãn and \nthe bliss of worshipping Bhagvãn in his own mind, then even if he can \nno longer remain within satsang and has to leave, he will experience \nhappiness \nand \nmisery \naccording \nto \nhis \nprãrabdha \nwhile \nremembering that bliss; he will not forget it.  But, what is there to \nrecall for someone who has not known that bliss of Bhagvãn and who \nhas not experienced it?  Nothing.  Such a person is like an animal.” \n \n37.4 Continuing, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Now, I shall narrate to you the \ngnãn of the murti of Bhagvãn.  No dev, human or anything created \nfrom Prakruti, possesses a murti like Bhagvãn.  In addition, Kãl \ndevours everything except Bhagvãn; Kãl’s powers are incapable of \naffecting Bhagvãn.  This is what Bhagvãn is like.  In fact, only Bhagvãn \nis like Bhagvãn; no one else can even compare to Him.  Also, a bhakta \nin the dhãm of Bhagvãn who has attained characteristics similar to \nBhagvãn also possesses a svarup similar to that of Bhagvãn.  \nNevertheless, that bhakta is still a mukta, and Bhagvãn is \nPurushottam.  Bhagvãn is supreme amongst everyone and is worthy \nto be worshipped by everyone.  He is also their master.  However, no \none can understand the greatness of that Bhagvãn.  He has a divya \nmurti, is nirgun, and is worthy of performing dhyãn upon.  In fact, that \nmurti of Bhagvãn is such that a person who performs dhyãn upon \nHim becomes nirgun himself. \nGADHADÃ III \n- 777 - \n37.5 “Moreover, while staying in one place, in His dhãm, Bhagvãn resides \nby way of His anvay form as the antaryãmi and the giver of the \ndeserved rewards of karmas to all the jeevs in countless brahmãnds.  \nHe is the very life of all jeevs; and without Him, those jeevs are not \ncapable of doing anything or indulging in anything. \n \n37.6 “In addition, that Bhagvãn is the master of all yogic powers.  Just as a \nperson who has attained yogic powers can obtain any object with his \nown hands, even in Brahm-Lok, while sitting here, similarly, Bhagvãn \nperforms all activities while staying in one place only using His yogic \npowers.  Also, for example, the fire that is latent within wood and \nstone is different from the wood and stone themselves.  Similarly, \nBhagvãn dwells within all jeevs, but His svarup is different from the \nsvarup of the jeevs. \n \n37.7 “That Bhagvãn Himself, possessing countless divya powers, becomes \nlike a human for the purpose of granting kalyãn to the jeevs.  If a \nperson develops the gnãn of that svarup of Bhagvãn in this way, then \nif he has offered bhakti to that Bhagvãn and has fully experienced the \nbliss of that gnãn and bhakti as it really is at least once in his jeev, he \nwill never forget it.  In fact, regardless of whatever happiness or \ndistress comes his way, he does not forget the experience of that bliss \nof Bhagvãn’s svarup, just as the king in a state of poverty does not \nforget the happiness of his past. \n \n37.8 “I tell you this because currently all of you are present in satsang; but, \ndue to unpleasant circumstances or unpleasant prãrabdha, if a \nperson no longer remains in satsang, then if he has understood this \nfact, his jeev can still attain kalyãn.  Also, if a person has such a belief, \nhe will never feel, ‘I will not attain kalyãn’.  After all, to continuously \nremain in satsang is indeed extremely difficult.  In fact, to physically \nbehave as described is also rare.  However, if a person someday \nhappens to leave satsang, then even if he cannot physically behave \nGADHADÃ III \n- 778 - \nlike this at that time, his jeev will still benefit greatly if he has \nunderstood this fact.  That is why I have delivered this talk.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 37 || 271 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 38 \nAvoiding The Six Desires \n \n38.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Vaishãkh sud 14 [17th May 1829], Swãmi \nShree Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj was sitting in the mandir of Shree \nGopinãthji in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed \nentirely in white clothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as \nharibhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. \n \n38.2 Then, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “Having thought about the Sãnkhya \nshãstras as well as other shãstras, I have formed the belief that all \nsvarups that are the result of the entities evolved from Mãyã are false.  \nThis is because all of those svarups will be destroyed by Kãl.  On the \nother hand, the svarup of Bhagvãn in Akshardhãm and the svarup of \nthe muktas – the pãrshads of Bhagvãn – are all satya, divya, and \nextremely luminous.  Also, the svarup of that Bhagvãn and those \nmuktas is two-armed like that of a human being, and it is \nsachidãnand.  That Bhagvãn, residing in Akshardhãm, is served by \nthose muktas with various types of divya items, and He is always \npresent there to bestow supreme bliss upon the muktas. \n \n38.3 “It is that same supreme Purushottam Bhagvãn who takes birth on \nthis earth out of compassion – for the purpose of granting kalyãn to \nthe jeevs.  He is presently visible before everyone; He is your ishta-\ndev; and He accepts your sevã.  In fact, there is absolutely no \ndifference between the pratyaksha svarup of Purushottam Bhagvãn \nvisible before you and the svarup of Bhagvãn residing in Akshardhãm; \nboth are one.  Also, this pratyaksha svarup of Purushottam Bhagvãn is \nthe controller of all, including Akshar.  He is the lord (sarvopari) of all \nGADHADÃ III \n- 779 - \nthe ishvars and the cause of all the avatãrs (avatãri).  Moreover, He is \nworthy of being worshipped by all of you.  The many previous \navatãrs of this Bhagvãn are worthy of being bowed down to and \nworthy of respect.” \n \n38.4 Shreeji Mahãrãj then explained, “A person who possesses the \nfollowing six characteristics will never become happy, either in this \nlife or even after death: greed for wealth and other things; desires to \nassociate with women; attachment of the tongue to various tastes; \nthe belief that a person is the body; affection for kusangis; and \nattachment to relatives.  Therefore, a person who desires to be happy \nshould eradicate these svabhãvs, maintain nivrutti, and not keep the \ncompany of those equal himself.  A person should also attach his jeev \nto the bhaktas of Bhagvãn – the great sant – who does not identify his \nself with the body, who possesses vairãgya, and who feels that he has \ndisobeyed a major ãgnã of Bhagvãn even if he has disobeyed a minor \nãgnã.  A person should act according to his ãgnã by thought, word, \nand deed.  Also, he should certainly avoid the vishays, and in no way \nshould he allow them to come near by abandoning his niyams.  If a \nperson does begin to associate with the vishays, he will certainly fall.  \nThis should be accepted as a universal principle.” \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 38 || 272 || \n \n \nGadhadã III – 39 \nVishalya-Karani Herbal Medicine \nThere Is Only One Bhagvãn \n \n39.1 In the Samvat year 1886, on Ashãdh vad 10 [25th July 1829], Shreeji \nMahãrãj was sitting on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of \nDãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white \nclothes.  A sabhã of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various \nplaces, had gathered before Him. \nGADHADÃ III \n- 780 - \n39.2 Addressing all the paramhans and satsangis, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, \n“What is Bhagvãn’s mãyã?  Well, mãyã is nothing but the sense of ‘I-\nness’ towards the body and ‘my-ness’ towards anything related to the \nbody.  These should be eradicated.  Anyone who eradicates mãyã can \nbe said to have gone beyond mãyã.  In fact, it is the principle of all the \nshãstras that a person should eradicate mãyã and develop love for \nBhagvãn.  This principle must be understood – either today or at \nsome time in the future.  Great bhaktas, such as Hanumãn, Nãrad, and \nPrahlãd, have also asked from Bhagvãn, ‘Protect us from mãyã in the \nform of ‘I-ness’ and ‘my-ness’, and may we develop love for you.  May we \nalso have the company of a sant who has gone beyond mãyã and has \nlove for you; and may we develop affection and a sense of ‘my-ness’ \ntowards him as well’.  Therefore, we too should do the same and ask \nfor the same, as well as do shravan, manan, and nididhyãs on this \nprinciple.” \n \n39.3 Then continuing, Shreeji Mahãrãj said, “A bhakta of Bhagvãn requires \nthe strength of two things:  ãtmã-nishthã and the greatness of \nBhagvãn.  What is ãtmã-nishthã?  It is to realise the ãtmã as being \ndistinct from the body.  If while staying among the sãdhus there \nhappens to be a quarrel from some reason, or if the feelings of ‘I-ness’ \nand ‘my-ness’, or vicious natures such as mãn, krodh, svãd, lobh, kãm, \nmatsar, and irshyã, prevail, then a person who does not regard \nhimself as the ãtmã perceives avgun in the sãdhus.  This would be \nextremely harmful for him.  That is why a person should realise his \ntrue self as being the ãtmã, distinct from the body. \n \n39.4 “That ãtmã is neither a brãhman, nor a kshatriya, nor a kanbi.  It is no \none’s son and no one’s father.  It belongs to no varna.  It is radiant like \nthe sun and fire; but it is also full of chaitanya.  The flames of fire and \nthe rays of the sun are jad because they do not move when touched \nby a finger.  However, when an ant is touched by a finger, it moves \nand turns back.  This implies that the ãtmã is full of consciousness.  It \nis said to be similar to the sun or to fire, but that is merely because its \nform is similar in radiance. \nGADHADÃ III \n- 781 - \n39.5 “The ãtmã has passed through countless life forms.  In fact, it is said \nthat a person has drank as much milk from his mothers as there is \nwater in the ocean.  In those lives, the ãtmã has experienced death in \ncountless ways, yet it has not perished.  It has remained as it is.  So, if \nit did not perish in that state of ignorance when it regarded itself as \nthe body, how shall it perish now that we have its gnãn?  Therefore, \nwe should realise that ãtmã as our true self. \n \n39.6 “Furthermore, how should the greatness of Bhagvãn be understood?  \nWell, Bhagvãn is the lord of the lords of countless brahmãnds.  \nHowever, the brahmãnds of which He is the lord are insignificant \ncompared to Him.  Therefore, it is said: \n \ndyupataya eva ten a yayur-antam anantatayã \ntvamapi yad-antarãnda-nichayã nanu sãvaranãhã \nEven the masters of the higher loks cannot understand your greatness, \nbecause it is endless.  Neither can you yourself understand your own greatness.  \nIn your each and every hair, countless brahmãnds and their barriers (jad \nprakruti) fly simultaneously at immense speed – like specks of dust flying in \nthe air.  Even the Shrutis, ultimately perish in you, and fail to praise your glory. \n \n39.7 “Within each brahmãnd there are Brahmã, Vishnu, and Shiv, as well as \nthe pruthvi with its seven dvips, seven oceans, Meru, and Lokã-Lok, \nand other mountains.  The brahmãnds also contain the fourteen loks, \nthe eight barriers, and many other things.  Bhagvãn is the lord of \ncountless such brahmãnds.  For example, person can realise the \nreputation of an emperor of the world, even though his villages can \nbe counted.  But, the reputation of Bhagvãn is much greater because \neven those countless brahmãnds are insignificant to Him.  So then, of \nwhat significance can the beings of those brahmãnds be before \nBhagvãn’s?  They are of no significance at all; they are utterly \ninsignificant. \n \n39.8 “Furthermore, in those brahmãnds, what are the pleasures of the \npanch-vishays that Bhagvãn has given to the jeevs like?  Well, those \nGADHADÃ III \n- 782 - \npleasures seem extremely rare; so much so, that many have given \ntheir heads for them.  However, the bliss of Bhagvãn’s own murti and \nof His dhãm are indeed outstanding.  The pleasures of the worldly \nvishays are dependent on other factors and must be experienced \ndistinctly.  In comparison, Bhagvãn is the reservoir of all forms of \nbliss.  Moreover, the bliss of Bhagvãn is imperishable and extremely \nalokik.  For this, consider the following analogy:  An extremely \nwealthy man enjoys a great variety of food at home.  Then, after \nfinishing the meal, he throws a leftover piece of rotlo to a dog.  In this \ncase, the leftover piece of rotlo can be considered utterly inferior, and \nthe various delicious foods that the wealthy man enjoys can be \nconsidered to be full of pleasure.  In the same way, Bhagvãn has given \nthe countless jeevs of the brahmãnds the pleasures of the panch-\nvishays; but they are inferior like the piece of rotlo thrown to the dog, \nwhereas the bliss of Bhagvãn Himself is far greater. \n \n39.9 “Even so, Bhagvãn grants a great deal of happiness to the jeev during \nthe state of sushupti.  During sushupti, a person is relieved of even \nsevere pain, and instead, he experiences profound peace. \n \n39.10 “Even the great bhaktas such as Brahmã, Shiv, Lakshmiji, Rãdhãji, \nNãrad, Shukji, the Sanakãdik, and the nine Yogeshvars apply the dust \nof Bhagvãn’s holy feet upon their heads.  They put aside all their self-\nimportance and constantly offer bhakti to Him. \n \n39.11 “Moreover, just look at the diverse creation created by Bhagvãn!  \nWhat creativity He has used!  Just see, a human is born of a human, \nand an animal from an animal; a tree from a tree, and an ant from an \nant.  Also, no matter how intelligent someone may be, no one is \ncapable of replacing a destroyed part of someone’s body exactly as it \nwas before.  Bhagvãn possesses innumerable such skills.  Therefore, \nby realising the greatness of Bhagvãn and realising Him to be blissful, \na person develops vairãgya for all things, and develops love for \nBhagvãn alone. \nGADHADÃ III \n- 783 - \n39.12 “If a person attains the gnãn of his jeevãtmã and the gnãn of \nBhagvãn’s greatness as mentioned earlier, then even if he has \nsomehow become attached to any sort of pleasures of the panch-\nvishays, he would not remain bound by them, but would  break that \nbondage and withdraw from them. Then, how can a person who \nabandons the pleasures of the panch-vishays become attached?  \nTherefore, having listened to these two types of gnãn, a person \nshould apply them within his mind with great enthusiasm.  For \nexample, a brave and fierce man would be extremely angered if an \nenemy killed his father.  If the enemy harassed him further by killing \nhis son and brother, kidnapping his wife, passing on his mother to a \nMuslim, as well as stealing all his belongings, the man would become \nincreasingly angered as he is harassed more and more.  At all times \nthen – while awake as well as in his dreams – he would be obsessed \nby only this.  In the same way, only when a person is constantly \nobsessed by these two topics can that gnãn be realised.  Then, that \ngnãn would assist him against any sort of difficulty that may occur.  \nFor example, when Hanumãnji brought the vishalya-karani herbal \nmedicine for Rãmchandraji and gave it to Him to drink, all the arrows \nfrom Rãmchandraji’s body fell out by themselves.  Similarly, all the \n‘arrows’ in the form of the desires of the indriyas to indulge in the \nvishays are removed when these two points have been embedded in a \nperson’s mind.  The vruttis of his indriyas withdraw from the \npleasures of the vishays and become rooted only in Bhagvãn.  Only he \nis a satsangi, because only he who associates with his own satya ãtmã \nand satya Bhagvãn can be called a satsangi. \n \n39.13 “If a religious person were to hear the talks of these two points, they \nwould stir his heart and pervade every pore of his body.  Conversely, \nif a demonic person were to hear them, they would not touch his \nheart at all; instead, they would exit from his ears, just as khir would \nnot remain in a dog’s stomach because the dog would vomit it out.  In \nactual fact, nothing can be said to be as delicious as khir, yet it does \nnot remain in a dog’s stomach, let alone pervade its body.  On the \nother hand, if a man were to eat khir, it would indeed pervade every \nGADHADÃ III \n- 784 - \npore of his body, and it would be extremely enjoyable.  Likewise, \nthese talks do not enter into the hearts of dog-like, demonic people; \nthese talks enter and pervade totally only in the hearts of religious \npeople.” \n \n39.14 Shreeji Mahãrãj then added, “Only Bhagvãn is like Bhagvãn.  Many \nhave attained qualities similar to His by worshipping Him, yet they \ncertainly do not become like Bhagvãn.  If they did become like \nBhagvãn, this would suggest the existence of several Bhagvãns.  As a \nresult, the control of the world would not remain organised.  One \nBhagvãn would say, ‘I will create the world’, while another Bhagvãn \nwould say, ‘I will destroy the world’.  One Bhagvãn would say, ‘I will \nmake it rain’, while another would say, ‘I will not’.  One Bhagvãn \nwould say, ‘I will instil human instincts in animals’, while another \nwould say, ‘I will instil animal instincts in humans’.  A stable state \nwould not be possible in this situation.  But, see how organised \neverything functions in the world!  There is not even the slightest \nirregularity.  Therefore, the ruler of all activities and the lord of all is \none Bhagvãn.  Not only that, it seems that no one can ever challenge \nHim.  Therefore, Bhagvãn is definitely one, and no one can become \nlike Him. \n \n39.15 “All these facts that I have revealed may be simple, but they include \neverything.  However, only the wise can grasp their essence, but not \nothers.  Whoever understands these facts and thoroughly \nstrengthens them has accomplished everything; he has nothing more \nto achieve.  Having listened to these talks delivered by me, a person \nshould keep the company of those bhaktas of Bhagvãn who have \nthoroughly absorbed them.  This will lead to the day-by-day \nstrengthening of those talks.” \n \n39.16 In conclusion, Shreeji Mahãrãj revealed, “I deliver these talks to you \nnot from any imagination of my mind, nor to display any sort of skill.  \nI have experienced all that I have spoken about.  In fact, I speak in \nGADHADÃ III \n- 785 - \naccordance to what I practise.  Outwardly, I may have a great deal of \ncontact with women, wealth, and the panch-vishays.  In fact, wherever \nI go – Surat, Amdãvãd, Vadodarã, Vadtãl – thousands of people \ngather; they obey me, honour me, and welcome me with great \nfestivity; and I stay in luxurious places and receive rich clothes and \nvehicles.  Despites all this, whenever I look towards my ãtmã and \ntowards the greatness of Bhagvãn, it all seems absolutely worthless.  \nI cannot become attached to any of it, and I become unaware of it all, \njust as a person is unaware of his past lives.  The reason I can behave \nin such way is that I have thoroughly realised the two topics \nmentioned before.  In fact, whoever realises them would also behave \naccordingly if ever he were somehow put in similar circumstances.  \nTherefore, these two topics should be understood by all means.” \n \n39.17 In this way, Shreeji Mahãrãj, out of great compassion, addressed \nothers on the basis of His own behaviour.  However, He is Shree \nPurushottam Nãrãyan. \n \n|| End of Vachanãmrut Gadhadã || 39 || 273 || \n \n \n|| End of Shree Gadhadã Antya Prakaran ||",
